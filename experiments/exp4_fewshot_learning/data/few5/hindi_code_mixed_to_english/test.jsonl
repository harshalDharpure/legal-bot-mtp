The law does not require an internal inquiry before reporting; in fact, delay or internal “verification” can be criticised. Section 21 POCSO is usually invoked when someone fails to report, not when they have reported promptly.

Good practice, aligned with POCSO and JJ Act norms, includes: immediate removal of the [Teacher] from contact with children (often suspension pending trial), written reporting to police, Childline 1098, and the District Child Protection Unit/Child Welfare Committee, maintaining a child protection policy, staff training on POCSO and mandatory reporting, and designating a Child Welfare/Protection Officer as per JJ Act Section 27.
