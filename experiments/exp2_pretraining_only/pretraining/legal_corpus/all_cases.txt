[case 1]
Sessions Court, Manjeri is the appellant. He was convicted as per
the impugned judgment for an offence punishable under Section
376 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). He was sentenced to
undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to
pay a fine of Rs. 10, 000/-. 2. The prosecution was initiated with the following allegations: At about 10. 00 p. m. on 08. 09. 2008 the accused committed rape on his daughter, PW1, aged 13 years at the house of his elder brother situated at Edapatta. He repeated committing rape on her at their house having door No. III/35 of Ponmala panchayat. It recurred till the last week of February 2009. Consequently, PW1 became pregnant and delivered a girl child at the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode on 03. 05. 2009. 3. On the appellant denying the charge, the prosecution has examined PWs. 1 to 7 and proved Exts. P1 to P14. MOs. 1 to 4 were identified. When questioned under Section 313(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Code), the appellant denied the incriminating circumstances. He filed a statement setting out his defence. He stated that he was unaware about the pregnancy of the victim, even when she was taken to the Medical College Hospital. He alleged that Mujeeb, son of PW5 was responsible for the pregnancy of PW1 and in order to save him, the appellant was implicated by PW1 under the persuasion of her mother, PW5. No evidence except Ext. D1, a contradiction in the former statement of PW1, was let in. 4. The trial court, after analysing the evidence in detail, concluded that PW1 was a reliable witness and her evidence coupled with the oral testimonies of PW4, the Doctor and PW5, the mother, proved the guilt of the appellant beyond doubt. The said finding and the reasons thereof are assailed in this appeal filed under Section 374(2) of the Code. 5. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Senior Public Prosecutor. 6. PW1 is the victim. She was aged 13 years at the time of occurrence. The appellant is her father and PW5 is her mother. PW1 was residing along with her siblings, the appellant and her mother (PW5). Her brother, Mujeed was born to PW5 in her first marriage. In her second wedlock of PW5 with the appellant, PW1 and her younger sister were born. All of them were residing together at their house at Ponmala. 7. The first incident of rape occurred at the house of the appellant's elder brother at Edapatta. Subsequently, on a few occasions she was subjected to sexual abuse by the appellant at their house at Ponmala. She has narrated about such incidents. The appellant took PW1 and her younger sister to the house of his elder brother, stating that his younger brother was coming home from abroad. On that day his elder brother was absent and his sister-in-law alone was there. 8. PW1 deposed that she and her sister slept in a room. After her sister went asleep, the appellant subjected her to sexual intercourse despite her residence. She deposed further that on subsequent occasions while they were at their house at Ponmala, she was subjected to sexual intercourse by the appellant on a few occasions during Ramadan season. 9. PW1 got impregnated. On noticing her swollen abdomen, PW5 along with the appellant took PW1 to a Doctor at Ponmala who noticed her to be pregnant, and instructed to take her to the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. After examination, PW4, a professor in Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Medical College, confirmed pregnancy. Age of the fetus was found to be above six months. Owing to her tender age, PW1 was retained in that hospital and a child was delivered by her. 10. PW5 deposed that she along with the appellant took PW1 on 09. 03. 2009 to the Doctor on noticing her abdominal distension. After confirmation of the pregnancy by the Doctor, PW1 told that the appellant was responsible. It is her further version that the appellant suggested to take PW1 to some hospitals and to do the necessary. Accordingly, PW1 was taken to the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. 11. PW4 was the Professor in Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Government Medical College, Kozhikode. She deposed that on 11. 03. 2009 she examined PW1 and at that time PW1 was carrying a fetus of 26 weeks of age. She was told by PW1 that her father was responsible for the pregnancy. PW4 proceeded to depose that being a case of teenage pregnancy, PW1 was retained in the hospital, and she gave birth to a child on 30. 05. 2009. She was discharged from the hospital on 03. 06. 2009. Ext. P5 is the certificate issued by PW4. 12. The F. I. statement, Ext. P1 was recorded from PW1 on 13. 03. 2009. Based on Ext. P1, the crime was registered. Ext. P6 is the FIR. PW7, Circle inspector of Police has conducted the investigation and laid the charge. A potency test of the appellant was conducted by PW3 and the certificate in that regard is Ext. P3. In the opinion of PW3, there was nothing to suggest that the appellant was incapable of doing sexual acts. 13. The proof or not of the charge against the appellant depends on the reliability of PW1. It was on 09. 03. 2009 she was examined by the Doctor and confirmed the pregnancy. On 11. 03. 2009 she was examined by PW4 at the Medical College Hospital, Kozhikode. On 13. 03. 2009 she gave Ext. P1 statement. Going by the oral evidence, immediately on revealing the pregnancy, PW1 told PW5 that the appellant was responsible. PW1 claimed to have stated that fact to the Doctor at Orchid Hospital, Malappuram, where she was scanned and examined. That Doctor was not examined. But PW4, who examined PW1 on 11. 03. 2009 stated in court that PW1 revealed the appellant as the person responsible and that version repeated in Ext. P1 that was given on 13. 03. 2009. Thus, from the very beginning, the version of PW1 regarding the person responsible for her pregnancy has been consistent. 14. The learned counsel would submit that PW1 accused the appellant in order to save Mujeeb, the son of PW5 in her first marriage. Various circumstances have been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant and it is submitted that since the only evidence available to implicate the appellant with the crime is the oral testimony of PW1, any doubt appeared in her evidence has to go in favour of the appellant. It is submitted, only if PW1 can be termed as a witness of sterling quality, there can be conviction. In that regard, the learned counsel placed reliance on the decision of this Court in Christopher v. State of Kerala [2024 KHC 7137] and a line of decisions referred to therein. 15. Inconsistencies in the evidence of PW1 highlighted by the learned counsel for the appellant are essentially a few improbabilities. Regarding the first incident, the narration by PW1 was that while sleeping along with her younger sister it occurred. That and the way in which she was allegedly abused are said to be improbable. The incidents allegedly occurred at their house at Ponmala were in the wee hours during Ramzan days. All were sleeping together. PW5 used to go to the kitchen at or around 4. 00 p. m. It was at that time PW1 was sexually misused. PW1 admitted her interaction with Mujeeb which was to the dislike of the appellant. He even warned PW5 against it. Although it was suggested that PW1 lied along with Mujeeb and she was therefore scolded by the appellant, it was denied by her. 16. It appears from the evidence that the appellant did not like PW1 interacting with Mujeeb closely. Along with that the version of PW5 to the effect that it was Mujeeb and not the appellant who was looking after the house hold affairs is highlighted. Those matters were relied in support of the defence plea that in order to save Mujeeb, the appellant was falsely implicated. Yet another aspect pointed out is that no scientific test like DNA examination was conducted and it was with an oblique motive of screening Mujeeb from the prosecution. 17. The aforementioned contentions are strongly refuted by the learned Public Prosecutor. It is submitted that the evidence of PW1 is blemish free. She being the daughter, it cannot be expected that she falsely implicate the appellant. Except suggestions by the appellant, there is no evidence or circumstance to even remotely probabilise the defence plea. Accordingly, the learned Senior Public Prosecutor would submit that the findings of the trial court are quite convincing and devoid of any infirmity. 18. Decisions of the Apex Court which dealt with the question concerning reliability of the victim of a sexual offence have been encapsulated by a Division Bench of this Court in the judgment in Christopher (supra). The relevant part of that judgment is extracted below:

Decisions of the Apex Court which dealt with the question concerning reliability of the victim of a sexual offence have been encapsulated by a Division Bench of this Court in the judgment in Christopher (supra). The relevant part of that judgment is extracted below: "26. In Nirmal Premkumar and another v. State, represented by Inspector of Police[(2024) SCC OnLine SC 260], the Apex Court while elucidating the principles that are to be borne in mind while appreciating oral testimony, it was observed as under in paragraph No. 11 of the judgment: "11. Law is well settled that generally speaking, oral testimony may be classified into three categories, viz. : (i) wholly reliable; (ii) wholly unreliable; (iii) neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable. The first two category of cases may not pose serious difficulty for the Court in arriving at its conclusion(s). However, in the third category of cases, the Court has to be circumspect and look for corroboration of any material particulars by reliable testimony, direct or circumstantial, as a requirement of the rule of prudence. " 27. In State of H. P. v. Raghubir Singh [(1993) 2 SCC 622], the Apex Court held that there is no legal compulsion to look for any other evidence to corroborate the evidence of the prosecutrix before recording an order of conviction. Evidence has to be weighed and not counted. Conviction can be recorded on the sole testimony of the prosecutrix if her evidence inspires confidence and there is absence of circumstances which militate against her veracity. 28. In Rai Sandeep v. State (NCT of Delhi) [(2012) 8 SCC 21], under what circumstances can a witness be categorized as a sterling witness, the Apex Court had held as under: "22. In our considered opinion, the 'sterling witness' should be of a very high quality and calibre whose version should, therefore, be unassailable. The court considering the version of such witness should be in a position to accept it for its face value without any hesitation. To test the quality of such a witness, the status of the witness would be immaterial and what would be relevant is the truthfulness of the statement made by such a witness. What would be more relevant would be the consistency of the statement right from the starting point till the end, namely, at the time when the witness makes the initial statement and ultimately before the court. It should be natural and consistent with the case of the prosecution qua the accused. There should not be any prevarication in the version of such a witness. The witness should be in a position to withstand the cross-examination of any length and howsoever strenuous it may be and under no circumstance should give room for any doubt as to the factum of the occurrence, the persons involved, as well as the sequence of it. Such a version should have co-relation with each and every one of other supporting material such as the recoveries made, the weapons used, the manner of offence committed, the scientific evidence and the expert opinion. The said version should consistently match with the version of every other witness. It can even be stated that it should be akin to the test applied in the case of circumstantial evidence where there should not be any missing link in the chain of circumstances to hold the accused guilty of the offence alleged against him. Only if the version of such a witness qualifies the above test as well as all other such similar tests to be applied, can it be held that such a witness can be called as a 'sterling witness' whose version can be accepted by the court without any corroboration and based on which the guilty can be punished. To be more precise, the version of the said witness on the core spectrum of the crime should remain intact while all other attendant materials, namely, oral, documentary and material objects should match the said version in material particulars in order to enable the court trying the offence to rely on the core version to sieve the other supporting materials for holding the offender guilty of the charge alleged. 29. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain [(1990) 1 SCC 550], the Apex Court held that a woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person's lust and, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. The Court observed as under in paragraph No. 16: "16. A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. " 30. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh[(1996) 2 SCC 384], the Apex Court held that in cases involving sexual harassment, molestation etc. , the court is duty-bound to deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. Minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of a prosecutrix should not be a ground for throwing out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. Evidence of the victim of sexual assault is enough for conviction and it does not require any corroboration unless there are compelling reasons for seeking corroboration. The court may look for some assurances of her statement to satisfy judicial conscience. The statement of the prosecutrix is more reliable than that of an injured witness as she is not an accomplice. The Court further held that the delay in filing FIR for sexual offence may not be even properly explained, but if found natural, the accused cannot be given any benefit thereof. The Court went on to observe as under in paragraph Nos. 8 & 21: "8. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. The court overlooked the situation in which a poor helpless minor girl had found herself in the company of three desperate young men who were threatening her and preventing her from raising any alarm. Again, if the investigating officer did not conduct the investigation properly or was negligent in not being able to trace out the driver or the car, how can that become a ground to discredit the testimony of the prosecutrix? The prosecutrix had no control over the investigating agency and the negligence of an investigating officer could not affect the credibility of the statement of the prosecutrix. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . The courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self-respecting woman would come forward in a court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxxx 21. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. The courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the court finds it difficult to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. 32. In State of Orissa v. Thakara Besra [(2002) 9 SCC 86], the Apex Court held that rape is not mere physical assault, rather it often destroys the whole personality of the victim. The rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female and, therefore, the testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case, and in such cases, non-examination even of other witnesses may not be a serious infirmity in the prosecution case, particularly where the witnesses had not seen the commission of the offence. 33. In Krishan Kumar Malik (supra), the Apex Court emphasized the duty of the court to differentiate between genuine cases from frivolous and concocted ones. It was held that the role of courts in such cases is to see whether the evidence available before the court is enough and cogent to prove the guilt of the accused. It was held as follows in paragraphs Nos. 31 and 32 of the judgment: 31. No doubt, it is true that to hold an accused guilty for commission of an offence of rape, the solitary evidence of the prosecutrix is sufficient provided the same inspires confidence and appears to be absolutely trustworthy, unblemished and should be of sterling quality. But, in the case in hand, the evidence of the prosecutrix, showing several lacunae, which have already been projected hereinabove, would go to show that her evidence does not fall in that category and cannot be relied upon to hold the appellant guilty of the said offences. 32. Indeed there are several significant variations in material facts in her Section 164 statement, Section 161 statement (CrPC), FIR and deposition in court. Thus, it was necessary to get her evidence corroborated independently, which they could have done either by examination of Ritu, her sister or Bimla Devi, who were present in the house at the time of her alleged abduction. The record shows that Bimla Devi though cited as a witness was not examined and later given up by the public prosecutor on the ground that she has been won over by the appellant. 33. After evaluating all the past precedents, the Apex Court in Nirmal Premkumar (supra) held that in cases where witnesses are neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable, the Court should strive to find out the true genesis of the incident. The Court can rely on the victim as a 'sterling witness' without further corroboration, but the quality and credibility must be exceptionally high. The statement of the prosecutrix ought to be consistent from the beginning to the end (minor inconsistencies excepted) from the initial statement to the oral testimony, without creating any doubt qua the prosecution's case. While a victim's testimony is usually enough for sexual offence cases, an unreliable or insufficient account from the prosecutrix, marked by identified flaws and gaps, could make it difficult for a conviction to be recorded.

Madhya Pradesh High Court Ashish Sharma vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 22 January, 2025 Author: Maninder S. Bhatti Bench: Maninder S. Bhatti NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2025: MPHC-JBP: 3251 1 MCRC-53467-2020 IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH AT JABALPUR BEFORE HON'BLE SHRI JUSTICE MANINDER S. BHATTI ON THE 22nd OF JANUARY, 2025 MISC. CRIMINAL CASE No. 53467 of 2020 ASHISH SHARMA AND OTHERS Versus THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS Appearance: Shri Prashant Shrivas - Advocate for petitioners. Shri C. K. Mishra - Govt. Advocate for State. Shri Y. K. Chaurasia - Advocate for respondent No. 2. WITH MISC. CRIMINAL CASE No. 14967 of 2021 RAJSREE SHARMA Versus RAJESH SHARMA AND OTHERS Appearance: Shri Y. K. Chaurasia - Advocate for petitioner. Shri Prashant Shrivas - Advocate for respondent No. 1. Shri C. K. Mishra - Govt. Advocate for State. ORDER Both the petitions, being interlinked, were heard analogously and they are disposed of by a common order. For the sake of clarity and convenience, the facts adumbrated in M. Cr. C. No. 53467/2020 are taken note of. 2. This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the CrPC assailing the order dated 20-08-2020 passed in Cr. R. No. 432/2020 by the Additional Sessions Judge, Patan District Jabalpur, arising out of the order dated 06-02-2020 passed in R. C. T. No. 538/2019 (State of M. P. vs. Ashish Sharma and others) by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Patan District Jabalpur. 3. The counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioner No. 1 is husband, petitioner No. 2 is father-in-law, petitioner No. 3 is mother-in-law, petitioner No. 4 is brother-in-law and petitioners No. 5 and 6 are sister-in-laws of the respondent No. 2. After marriage of the petitioner No. 1 with the respondent No. 2, on 02-12-2015, certain disputes cropped up and a complaint was lodged against the petitioners under sections 498-A, 323, 34 and 506 of the IPC and under Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. After filing of the charge-sheet, the trial Court proceeded to frame charges against the petitioners. The order framing charges was assailed by the petitioners by filing a revision before the revisional Court and the revisional Court has dismissed the revision. 4. The counsel for the petitioners contends that the FIR, if is read minutely, it would reveal that the entire allegations against the petitioners are baseless, vague, omnibus and general. It is contended by the counsel that if the allegations pertaining to the alleged demand of dowry are seen, it would reveal that the allegations are general and omnibus. It is nowhere stated by the complainant in the FIR that on which date and what time and place, she was subjected to demand of dowry or alleged cruelty. There are no mention of specific instances so far as the present petitioners are concerned. It is contended by the counsel that there is abnormal surge in cases against the family members of the husband, and following the same trend, respondent No. 2 has made an attempt to implicate the present petitioners. The petitioners No. 2 to 6 have been implicated only on the ground, that they are relatives of the petitioner No. 1, who is husband of the respondent No. 2. 5. It is further contended by the counsel that an application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed by the respondent No. 2, and the said application was allowed and a decree of divorce was passed on 02-07-2022. After passing of the decree of divorce on 02-07-2022, the respondent No. 2 - wife entered into a second wedlock on 09-07-2022 and the judgment and decree of divorce is under challenge in the appeal before this Court. It is contended by the counsel for the petitioners that in such circumstances, the order impugned as well as proceedings pending against the petitioners deserve to be quashed. 6. To buttress his submissions, the counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the decisions rendered in the cases of K. V. Prakash Babu vs. State of Karnataka, AIR 2016 SC 5430; Lalita Kumari vs. Govt. of U. P. and ors, (2014) 2 SCC 1; Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others vs. State of Bihar and others, 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 141; Ravikant Dubey vs. State of M. P. , 2014 (2) MPHT 449; and Shakson Belthissor vs. State of Kerala and another, (2009) 14 SCC 466. In order to substantiate his contentions, the counsel has placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the cases of K. V. Prakash Babu (supra) while submitting that even if the husband is living in adultery, the same ipso facto does not amount to causing 'cruelty' within the meaning of Section 498-A of the IPC. 7. Per contra, the counsel for the respondent No. 2 submits that the present petition deserves to be dismissed. It is contended by the counsel that charges against the present petitioners were framed by the trial Court and the revisional Court, meticulously considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners and ultimately passed the order rejecting the revision. It is contended by the counsel that though the revision in respect of another co-accused, Rajesh Sharma has been allowed, but even against Rajesh Sharma, charges ought to have been framed. Assailing the said part by which charge against Rajesh Sharma has been quashed, the connected M. Cr. C. No. 14967/2021 has been preferred by the respondent No. 2. 8. The counsel for the respondent No. 2 contends that the FIR speaks volume about the act of cruelty at the behest of the present petitioners. There was continuous demand of dowry and specific instances of demand of dowry has been mentioned. It is specifically mentioned that when after the marriage, the respondent No. 2 after visiting her parental house and again went to the matrimonial house, she was subjected to demand of dowry. Thereafter, again there was demand of a four wheeler by the father-in-law and mother-in-law. It is further alleged in the FIR that the petitioner No. 1 was in an extramarital affair with a woman and the said woman used to visit the matrimonial house, and whenever the said woman used to visit, the respondent No. 2 was locked in a room, and she was not allowed to speak. The respondent No. 2 was not in a position to communicate with that woman. Later on, the said woman informed the respondent No. 2 that she was in a relationship with the petitioner No. 1. 9. It is further contended by the counsel for the respondent that the petitioner No. 1 had no physical relationship with the respondent No. 2 also, and the petitioners were torturing the respondent No. 2. 10. Heard the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties and perused the records. 11. A perusal of the record reflects that the respondent No. 2, who is the wife of the petitioner No. 1, lodged an FIR with the police, alleging that after her marriage with the petitioner No. 1 on 02-12-2015, she was subjected to cruelty under the garb of demand of dowry. In the FIR it is mentioned that certain household articles, jewelry and a two-wheeler etc. were given at the time of the marriage. After the marriage, there was a demand by the petitioners for a four-wheeler. Later on, the respondent No. 2 came to know, that the petitioner No. 1 was having extramarital affairs with a woman. The said woman was frequently visiting the matrimonial house, where the respondent No. 2 was residing with the petitioners and whenever the said woman used to visit, the respondent No. 2 was locked in a separate room. The petitioners were aware of the relationship with the petitioner No. 1 with the said woman. 12. It is further mentioned in the FIR that the said woman used to go to market along with the mother-in-law as well as both the sister-in-laws. Identity of the said woman was being not disclosed to the respondent No. 2. Later on, somehow the respondent No. 2 talked to the said woman and she informed that she was in a relation with the petitioner No. 1. She also provided a photograph in which she was there with the petitioner No. 1. In the later part of the FIR, there is again demand of a four-wheeler. 13. It is further alleged in the FIR that during a prolonged period of three years, there was intercourse hardly on 10-12 occasions. The petitioner No. 1 used to avoid intercourse and even, a separate room in which the respondent No. 2 along with the petitioner No. 1 was staying, was let out to a tenant. Therefore, entire family members were sharing two rooms and thus, there was no physical relationship. According to respondent No. 2, this was intentionally done by the petitioners. 14. Denial to enter into sexual intercourse by a spouse also amounts to cruelty, as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh, (2007) 4 SCC 511, wherein in para 101 it ruled thus: "101. No uniform standard can ever be laid down for guidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some instances of human behavior which may be relevant in dealing with the cases of 'mental cruelty'. The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only illustrative and not exhaustive: (i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties to live with each other could come within the broad parameters of mental cruelty. (ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that the situation is such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with the other party. (iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of manner, indifference and neglect may reach such a degree that it makes the married life for the other spouse absolutely intolerable. (iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time may lead to mental cruelty. (v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating treatment calculated to torture, discommode or render miserable life of the spouse. (vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behavior of one spouse actually affecting the physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial, and weighty. (vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, indifference or total departure from the normal standard of conjugal kindness causing injury to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also amount to mental cruelty. (viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day-to-day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill conduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and behavior of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty. (xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of sterilization without medical reasons and without the consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly, if the wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to mental cruelty. (xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for a considerable period without there being any physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty. (xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife after marriage not to have a child from the marriage may amount to cruelty. (xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty. " 15. In the present case, it is undisputed that the FIR clearly reveals that the petitioner No. 1 was having extramarital affairs. The fact of extramarital affair, as per the first information report, was well known to the petitioners No. 2 to 6. The petitioner No. 1 intentionally let out the room in which the petitioner No. 1 and respondent No. 2 were residing. Thus, there was refusal by the petitioner No. 1 to cohabit with the respondent No. 2. In the detailed FIR it is clearly mentioned that the lady with whom the petitioner No. 1 was in extramarital affairs, was visiting the house of the petitioners frequently and during those visits, the respondent No. 2 was made to stay in a locked room, and these facts were in the knowledge of the petitioners. 16. The aforesaid acts of the petitioner, in the light of the law laid down in Samar Ghosh vs. Jaya Ghosh (supra) prima facie amount to "cruelty" and therefore, the trial Court did not commit any error in framing the charge against the present petitioners. The revisional Court also has not committed any error in passing the impugned order and has rightly allowed the revision, so far as the same pertains to the co-accused Rajesh Sharma. So far as the co-accused Rajesh Sharma was concerned, there were no allegations of causing any cruelty except the fact, that he was instrumental in arranging the marriage of the respondent No. 2 with the petitioner No. 1. The judgments relied upon by the petitioners are distinguishable on facts. 17. In view of the preceding analysis, this Court does not find any merit in the instant petitions preferred by the petitioners under Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. , and the same being sans substance, deserve to be and are hereby dismissed. (MANINDER S. BHATTI) JUDGE ac

CRIMINAL CASE No. 53467 of 2020 ASHISH SHARMA AND OTHERS Versus THE STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH AND OTHERS Appearance: Shri Prashant Shrivas - Advocate for petitioners. Shri C. K. Mishra - Govt. Advocate for State. Shri Y. K. Chaurasia - Advocate for respondent No. 2. WITH MISC. CRIMINAL CASE No. 14967 of 2021 RAJSREE SHARMA Versus RAJESH SHARMA AND OTHERS Appearance: Shri Y. K. Chaurasia - Advocate for petitioner. Shri Prashant Shrivas - Advocate for respondent No. 1. Shri C. K. Mishra - Govt. Advocate for State. ORDER Both the petitions, being interlinked, were heard analogously and they are disposed of by a common order. For the sake of clarity and convenience, the facts adumbrated in M. Cr. C. No. 53467/2020 are taken note of. 2. This petition has been filed under Section 482 of the CrPC assailing the order dated 20-08-2020 passed in Cr. R. No. 432/2020 by the Additional Sessions Judge, Patan District Jabalpur, arising out of the order dated 06-02-2020 passed in R. C. T. No. 538/2019 (State of M. P. vs. Ashish Sharma and others) by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Patan District Jabalpur. 3. The counsel for the petitioners contends that the petitioner No. 1 is husband, petitioner No. 2 is father-in-law, petitioner No. 3 is mother-in-law, petitioner No. 4 is brother-in-law and petitioners No. 5 and 6 are sister-in-laws of the respondent No. 2. After marriage of the petitioner No. 1 with the respondent No. 2, on 02-12-2015, certain disputes cropped up and a complaint was lodged against the petitioners under sections 498-A, 323, 34 and 506 of the IPC and under Section 3/4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. After filing of the charge-sheet, the trial Court proceeded to frame charges against the petitioners. The order framing charges was assailed by the petitioners by filing a revision before the revisional Court and the revisional Court has dismissed the revision. 4. The counsel for the petitioners contends that the FIR, if is read minutely, it would reveal that the entire allegations against the petitioners are baseless, vague, omnibus and general. It is contended by the counsel that if the allegations pertaining to the alleged demand of dowry are seen, it would reveal that the allegations are general and omnibus. It is nowhere stated by the complainant in the FIR that on which date and what time and place, she was subjected to demand of dowry or alleged cruelty. There are no mention of specific instances so far as the present petitioners are concerned. It is contended by the counsel that there is abnormal surge in cases against the family members of the husband, and following the same trend, respondent No. 2 has made an attempt to implicate the present petitioners. The petitioners No. 2 to 6 have been implicated only on the ground, that they are relatives of the petitioner No. 1, who is husband of the respondent No. 2. 5. It is further contended by the counsel that an application under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act was filed by the respondent No. 2, and the said application was allowed and a decree of divorce was passed on 02-07-2022. After passing of the decree of divorce on 02-07-2022, the respondent No. 2 - wife entered into a second wedlock on 09-07-2022 and the judgment and decree of divorce is under challenge in the appeal before this Court. It is contended by the counsel for the petitioners that in such circumstances, the order impugned as well as proceedings pending against the petitioners deserve to be quashed. 6. To buttress his submissions, the counsel for the petitioners has placed reliance on the decisions rendered in the cases of K. V. Prakash Babu vs. State of Karnataka, AIR 2016 SC 5430; Lalita Kumari vs. Govt. of U. P. and ors, (2014) 2 SCC 1; Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam and others vs. State of Bihar and others, 2022 LiveLaw (SC) 141; Ravikant Dubey vs. State of M. P. , 2014 (2) MPHT 449; and Shakson Belthissor vs. State of Kerala and another, (2009) 14 SCC 466. In order to substantiate his contentions, the counsel has placed reliance on the decision of the Apex Court rendered in the cases of K. V. Prakash Babu (supra) while submitting that even if the husband is living in adultery, the same ipso facto does not amount to causing 'cruelty' within the meaning of Section 498-A of the IPC. 7. Per contra, the counsel for the respondent No. 2 submits that the present petition deserves to be dismissed. It is contended by the counsel that charges against the present petitioners were framed by the trial Court and the revisional Court, meticulously considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the petitioners and ultimately passed the order rejecting the revision. It is contended by the counsel that though the revision in respect of another co-accused, Rajesh Sharma has been allowed, but even against Rajesh Sharma, charges ought to have been framed.

respondent No. 1.
Virender Singh, Judge
Petitioners have filed the present petition, under
Section 528 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita,
2023 (hereinafter referred to as 'BNSS'), for quashing of FIR
No. 44 of 2020, dated 02. 11. 2020, (hereinafter referred to the
FIR, in question), registered with Women Police
Station Baddi, District Solan, H. P. , under Section 376 of
the Indian Penal Code, (hereinafter referred to as the 'IPC')
and Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as the 'POCSO
Act'), as well as, proceedings resultant thereto, which are
stated to be pending, before the Court of learned Principal
Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board Court, Solan, H. P. , in
Case No. 22/2 of 2021, titled as 'State Vs. Saurav'.
2. The present petition has been filed by the
petitioners to quash the FIR, in question. In the present
case, petitioner No. 1 is the accused, whereas, petitioner
No. 2 is the child victim.
3. The main ground, upon which, the quashing of
FIR has been sought, is that during the pendency of the
case, petitioners have solemnized the marriage on
21. 02. 2025. In this regard, they have relied upon the
marriage certificate.
4. Not only this, petitioners have also pleaded that
they have been blessed with two children.
5. Perusal of record shows that FIR, in question,
has been lodged on the statement of respondent No. 2, who,
at the relevant time, was working as Legal-cum-Probation
Officer, District Child Protection Unit, District Solan, H. P.
6. In this background, when, learned counsel,
appearing for the petitioners, has been confronted with the
maintainability of the present petition, then, learned
counsel for the petitioners could not satisfy the judicial
conscience of this Court.
7. The FIR, in question, has been registered,
under the special statute i. e. POCSO Act. The Legislature,
in its wisdom, has enacted the special statute, i. e. POCSO
Act, by keeping in mind the rising number of cases, being
committed against the children. Once, it has been held
that the offences are against the State, then, it is the duty
of the State to prosecute the offender, before the competent
8. As observed earlier, the Legislature, in its
wisdom, has enacted the POCSO Act, with an object to
reduce the child abuse and protection of the children from
sexual offences. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Criminal
Appeal No. 3403 of 2023, titled as 'Ramji Lal Bairwa &
Anr. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors. ', Neutral Citation
No. 2024 (INSC) 846, has elaborately discussed the
provisions of POCSO Act and has held that the quashing of
the proceedings, under Section 528 of the BNSS, in POCSO
cases, on the basis of the settlement, is against the
legislative intent, behind the enactment. Relevant
paragraphs 10 to 12 and 31 of the said judgment are
reproduced, as under: -
"10. Before dealing with the contentions on
behalf of the respondents and also the
submissions of the learned amicus curiae and
the counsel for the intervenor, we think it only
appropriate to refer to certain relevant aspects of
the POCSO Act. As introduction to the POCSO
Act, what actually actuated the Parliament to
enact 'POCSO Act' has been stated thus: -
"Sexual offences against children are not
adequately addressed by the existing laws. A
large number of such offences are neither
specifically provided with nor are they
adequately penalised. Such offences against
children need to be defined explicitly and
countered through adequate penalties as an
effective deterrence. This Act provides for
protection of children from offences of sexual
assault, sexual harassment and pornography
with due regard for safeguarding the interest
and well-being of children. "
11. Contextually, it is worthy to refer to the
statement of objects and reasons for the
enactment of the POCSO Act. It reads as
5 2025: HHC: 5611
"STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
Article 15 of the Constitution, inter alia,
confers upon the State powers to make special
provision for children. Further, article 39, inter
alia, provides that the State shall in particular
direct its policy towards securing that the
tender age of children are not abused and
their childhood and youth are protected
against exploitation and they are given
facilities to develop in a healthy manner and
in conditions of freedom and dignity.
2. The United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Children, ratified by India on 11th
December, 1992, requires the State Parties to
undertake all appropriate national, bilateral
and multilateral measures to prevent (a) the
inducement or coercion of a child to engage in
any unlawful sexual activity; (b) the

paragraphs 10 to 12 and 31 of the said judgment are
reproduced, as under: -
"10. Before dealing with the contentions on
behalf of the respondents and also the
submissions of the learned amicus curiae and
the counsel for the intervenor, we think it only
appropriate to refer to certain relevant aspects of
the POCSO Act. As introduction to the POCSO
Act, what actually actuated the Parliament to
enact 'POCSO Act' has been stated thus: -
"Sexual offences against children are not
adequately addressed by the existing laws. A
large number of such offences are neither
specifically provided with nor are they
adequately penalised. Such offences against
children need to be defined explicitly and
countered through adequate penalties as an
effective deterrence. This Act provides for
protection of children from offences of sexual
assault, sexual harassment and pornography
with due regard for safeguarding the interest
and well-being of children. "
11. Contextually, it is worthy to refer to the
statement of objects and reasons for the
enactment of the POCSO Act. It reads as

"STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS
Article 15 of the Constitution, inter alia,
confers upon the State powers to make special
provision for children. Further, article 39, inter
alia, provides that the State shall in particular
direct its policy towards securing that the
tender age of children are not abused and
their childhood and youth are protected
against exploitation and they are given
facilities to develop in a healthy manner and
in conditions of freedom and dignity.
2. The United Nations Convention on the
Rights of Children, ratified by India on 11th
December, 1992, requires the State Parties to
undertake all appropriate national, bilateral
and multilateral measures to prevent (a) the
inducement or coercion of a child to engage in

[case 7]
Counsel for Applicant: - Jitendra Pal Singh, Pradeep Kumar Singh
Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A.
Hon'ble Dinesh Kumar Singh-I, J.
Heard Sri Pradeep Kumar Singh, learned counsel for the applicant and Sri G. P. Singh, learned A. G. A. for the State.
This Application under Section 482 Cr. P. C. has been filed with a prayer to quash the Charge-Sheet No. 338 of 2018 dated 16. 11. 2018 as well as entire criminal proceeding of S. T. No. 142 of 2018 arising out of Case Crime No. 393 of 2018 under Sections 363, 366, 376 I. P. C. and 3/4 of P. O. C. S. O. Act, P. S. Jahanabad, District Pilibhit.
Learned counsel for the applicant argued that O. P. No. 2 is father of the victim and victim has married the accused applicant regarding which he has drawn attention of the Court towards page no. 24 of the paper book in which the victim has stated that she is 19 years old. 15 days ago, she had gone with the accused, thereafter on the next date, she married the accused applicant out of her own free will in Allahabad. Further attention has also been drawn of this Court towards the order of this Court passed in Habeas Corpus Writ Petition No. 54 of 2019 dated 20. 02. 2019 wherein reference is made of the statement of victim who had stated before court that she is 19 years old and is not literate and had gone with the accused applicant out of her own free will and had married the applicant. The attention is also drawn towards the observation made by the Bench which is as follows:
"In view of the categorical statement made by the corpus before this Court that she is an adult, even as per the record she is an adult and even by appearance and the manner in which she has faced the Court, this Court has got no doubt that she is an adult and is well aware of her rights, a case for grant of indulgence has been made out. "
Citing the above piece of evidence, learned counsel for the applicant has argued that I. O. has over-looked all these aspects and has submitted charge-sheet in the present case in routine manner which is nothing but abuse of process of law and the same needs to be quashed.
Learned A. G. A. has vehemently opposed the prayer of quashing and has drawn attention towards the statement of informant which is annexed at page no. 26 of the paper book in which he has stated that his daughter had studied up to class-V and that he was providing Transfer Certificate. He has stated the age of the victim to be 16 years, therefore in view of the above, it is argued that the age of the victim is required to be determined in accordance with the provision of Section 94 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 as has been held in Crl. Misc. Writ Petition No. 20816 of 2016, Nisha Naaz alias Anuradha and Another Vs. State of U. P. & 2 others decided on 6. 02. 2019 in which decision of Suhani Vs. State of U. P. , 2018 SCC Online SC 781 has been distinguished and the finding of Hon'ble Apex Court in Jarnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana (2013) 7 SCC 263 has been followed which provides that victim's age shall also be decided following the same provision as are followed for determining the age of a juvenile which provides as follows: -
"94. Presumption and determination of age- (1)Where, it is obvious to the Committee or the Board, based on the appearance of the person brought before it under any of the provisions of this Act (other than for the purpose of giving evidence) that the said person is a child, the Committee or the Board shall record such observation stating the age of the child as nearly as may be and proceed with the inquiry under section 14 or section 36, as the case may be, without waiting for further confirmation of the age.
2. In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining?
i. the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence thereof;
ii. the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;
iii. and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board:
Provided such age determination test conducted on the order of the Committee or the Board shall be completed within fifteen days from the date of such order.
3. The age recorded by the Committee or the Board to be the age of person so brought before it shall, for the purpose of this Act, be deemed to be the true age of that person. "
It would be further pertinent to mention here the judgment of Apex Court rendered in Independent Thought vs. Union of India and another, (2017) 10 SCC 800, paragraph nos. 1 and 107 of which are as under:
"1. The issue before us is a limited but one of considerable public importance? whether sexual intercourse between a man and his wife being a girl between 15 and 18 years of age is rape? Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) answers this in the negative, but in our opinion sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of age is rape regardless of whether she is married or not. The Exception carved out in IPC creates an unnecessary and artificial distinction between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child and has no rational nexus with any unclear objective sought to be achieved. The artificial distinction is arbitrary and discriminatory and is definitely not in the best interest of the girl child. The artificial distinction is contrary to the philosophy and ethos of Article 15(3) of the Constitution as well as contrary to Article 21 of the Constitution and our commitments in international conventions. It is also contrary to the philosophy behind some statutes, the bodily integrity of the girl child and her reproductive choice. What is equally dreadful, the artificial distinction turns a blind eye to trafficking of the girl child and surely each one of us must discourage trafficking which is such a horrible social evil. "

[case 8]
State vs Rohit @ Sonu on 4 May, 2018 IN THE COURT OF SHRI BALWANT RAI BANSAL, ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­01, SPECIAL COURT (POCSO), SOUTH, NEW DELHI CIS­SC No. 530/17 FIR No. 410/17 PS: Mehrauli In the matter of: State versus Rohit @ Sonu S/o: Sh. Ashok Chauhan R/o: House No. 363, Firoz Gandhi Colony, Basai Road, Gurugram, Haryana. .. .. .. .. .. .. Accused. Date of Institution: 23. 09. 2017. Date of Reserving Judgment: Unreserved. Date of Pronouncement: 04. 05. 2018. Accused Rohit @ Sonu S/o Sh. Ashok Chauhan has been facing trial for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 r/w 5 of the POCSO Act 2012 and section 376 (2) of the IPC, on the allegations that, he committed rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the girl child (the victim/prosecutrix), namely, 'N' (PW1, whose real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged 16 years. The brief facts of the case are that on 23. 06. 2017, the prosecutrix came to the PS­ Mehrauli and made a complaint to the police that she was sexually abused by a boy, namely, Rohit @ Sonu by promising to marry her. She also alleged that she also got pregnant and when she disclosed this fact to Rohit, he suggested her to terminate the pregnancy and on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which, her pregnancy was terminated. She alleged that on 19. 06. 2017, Rohit made physical relations with her lastly and on 20. 06. 2017, despite her repeated insistence, he refused to marry with her. Making the said complaint, the prosecutrix prayed for legal action against accused Rohit. Thereafter, the site plan of the place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of the prosecutrix and accused Rohit was arrested. The prosecutrix and the accused were medically examined. The statement of the prosecutrix was also recorded under section 164 Cr. P. C. During the course of the investigation, the age proof of the prosecutrix was also collected. After completion of the investigation, the charge­sheet was prepared and filed in the court concerned for the commission of the offences punishable under sections 313/376 of the IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act 2012. Charge for the commission of the offences punishable under section 6 of the POCSO Act and section 376 (2) of the IPC was framed against the accused Rohit @ Sonu, to which, the accused pleaded not­guilty and claimed trial, and the case was proceeded for prosecution evidence. In the list of witnesses, the prosecution cited 16 witnesses, out of which, two witnesses, including the prosecutrix as PW1 and her mother as PW2, have been examined so far. It is submitted by Ld. Counsel for the accused that the prosecutrix who is the main witness of the prosecution has already been examined as PW1 alongwith her mother as PW2, who is the hearsay witness, and no other public witness remained to be examined. He submitted that PW1, who is the main and crucial witness, has not supported the case of the prosecution. The Ld. Counsel has submitted that since nothing incriminating evidence has come against the accused, therefore, to save the precious time and manpower and resources of the court, the further proceedings in the present case may be stopped, and the accused may be acquitted of the offences charged against him. On the other hand, the Ld. Special Public Prosecutor has opposed the contentions made by the counsel for the accused. I have considered the submissions made on behalf of both the parties and have gone through the record of the case. There are 16 witnesses cited by the prosecution in the list of witnesses, to prove its case. Out of the said 16 prosecution witnesses, two witnesses have already been examined, including the prosecutrix as PW1. It is pertinent to evaluate herein the testimony of PW1, who is the main and important witness of the prosecution, to decide the fate of the case. PW1, the prosecutrix 'N' (full particulars are mentioned at Sl. No. 01 in the list of the witnesses and the name withheld in order to conceal her identity) deposed that on 19. 06. 2017, it was the birthday of Rohit and they had celebrated his birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. In the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them. On the next day, he did not pick up her phone and she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with Rohit for the last 4 ­ 5 years and he is not picking her phone. She stated that police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She deposed that Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She deposed that she has married with Rohit on 23. 08. 2017. PW1 (the prosecutrix) was cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor and during her cross­examination, she denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. PW2, namely, 'S' (full particulars withheld in order to conceal the identity) is the mother of the prosecutrix, who also turned hostile. In her evidence, she stated that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and she did not tell about their relationship or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her. PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor, in which, she also denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor. As already mentioned, the accused has been facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 of POCSO Act. As per the case of the prosecution, the prosecutrix was raped by the accused since March 2015 till 19. 06. 2017, on several occasions, on the pretext of marriage, and also got pregnant, and the accused got her pregnancy terminated. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically stated that on 19. 06. 2017, on the day of the birthday of the accused, they had celebrated the birthday in her house and thereafter, they went for shopping. She stated that in the evening, after shopping, Rohit dropped her to her house. She also stated that she was asking him to marry her but he was not giving the clear answer and therefore, a quarrel took place between them, and on the next day when he did not pick up her phone, she went to the police station and told the police that she was having friendship with the accused for the last 4­5 years and he is not picking up her phone call. She categorically stated that the police obtained her signatures on some blank papers. She specifically stated that accused Rohit did not do any wrongful act with her and they were only friends. She stated that on 23. 08. 2017, she had married with the accused. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, she categorically denied the suggestion that in March 2015, at about 10: 00am, when her mother had gone for job and her siblings were at school and she was alone, Rohit came to her house and he proposed her for marriage. She also denied the suggestions that thereafter, Rohit made physical relationship with her consent or that thereafter, she had also introduced Rohit with her mother or that Rohit also talked with her mother for their marriage and her mother had agreed for the same. She also denied the suggestion that on 05. 01. 2017, Rohit refused to marry her and told her that if she would pressurize to marry him, then he would defame her in her relations. PW1 (the prosecutrix) categorically denied the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that Rohit made physical relationship with her on the pretext of marriage after alluring and enticing her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that Rohit has been making physical relationship with her for the last two years. She also denied the correctness of the suggestions that during the period December 2016 to March 2017, she also became pregnant and when she told the same to Rohit, he asked her to terminate the pregnancy or that on his persistent advice, she ate hot things due to which her pregnancy was terminated. She also denied the suggestion that on 19. 06. 2017, accused Rohit came to her house for celebrating his birthday and on the said day, he lastly made physical relationship with her. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that the site plan Ex. PW1/B was prepared by the police at her instance. As per the MLC report of the prosecutrix, the sexual assault history narrated to the doctor is 'consensual sexual intercourse with Mr. Rohit who promised to marry her, and the last sexual intercourse was held on 19. 06. 2017'. However, PW1 (the prosecutrix) also denied the correctness of the suggestion put by the Ld. Prosecutor that at the time of her medical examination by the doctor, she had told to the doctor that she had consensual sexual relationship with accused Rohit. On seeing her statement Ex. PW1/E under section 164 Cr. P. C. , she voluntarily stated that she had given the said statement to the Magistrate on the advice of Priyanka Madam who was the police official, as she had told her that if she would not give the said statement, her marriage would not be solemnized with Rohit. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that she had told to the Magistrate all the true and correct facts voluntarily and on her own and not at the advice of the police official Priyanka. On the other hand, while evaluating the testimony of PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix), who is a hearsay witness, it reveals that she has also not supported the case of the prosecution at all, stating that her victim daughter was having friendly relations with Rohit being the neighbour, and her victim daughter did not tell her about her relationship with the accused Rohit or that Rohit has committed any wrongful act with her, and this witness was also cross­examined by the Ld. Prosecutor. In her cross­examination by the Ld. Prosecutor, PW2 (the mother of the prosecutrix) denied the correctness of the suggestions put by the Ld. Prosecutor that her victim daughter had told her that she loved Rohit and wanted to marry him, or that on her insistence, her victim daughter told her that they had also made physical relationship with each other. She also denied the correctness of the suggestion that on 20. 06. 2017, her victim daughter told her that Rohit and his family members are refusing to marry with her. She also denied having ever made statement Mark­PW2/A to the police. In view of the aforesaid discussions, particularly, keeping in view the testimony of PW1 (the prosecutrix), in my considered opinion, no useful purpose will be served by examining the remaining prosecution witnesses, as it will not affect the fate of the case. The other prosecution witnesses are formal witnesses, most of which are police officials. There is no medical and forensic evidence on record to prove the case of the prosecution that the accused had made physical relations with the victim. In these circumstances, continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence has been closed and the SA of the accused has been dispensed with. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case and the aforesaid discussions, there being no evidence against the accused, accused Rohit @ Sonu is entitled to be acquitted, and accordingly, the accused is not found guilty of committing the offences punishable under sections 376 (2) of IPC and section 6 read with section 5 of POCSO Act, and consequently, he is acquitted of the said offences. However, Rohit @ Sonu is required to furnish bail bond in the sum of Rs. 10, 000/­ with one surety of like amount, under section 437A of Cr. P. C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. The bail bonds are furnished and the same are accepted. File be consigned to Record Room, after necessary compliance.

Point No. 1(a) to (d): - All the points are taken up together as they are inter related to each other. 9. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that accused since from one year back accused committed sexual assault against the victim girl Cw2 against her will and since from 2 years accused used to touch her body and used to show obscene videos and misbehaved with her. 10. Now let me consider the other oral evidence adduced by the prosecution. 11. Pw1 victim girl deposed in her evidence that she has not given statement before the police alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and she is not aware of the contents written in Ex. P1 and Ex. P2, wherein she put her signature. She also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she denied that she has lodged complaint as per Ex. p2 alleging that accused misbehaved with her and committed sexual assault and raped her and police drew mahazer as per Ex. P1. She also denied that she has given statement before the police as per Ex. P3 stating that accused misbehaved with her and committed rape showing obscene videos. She also stated that Ex. P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed Ex. P2. 12. Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl deposed that she has not given statement before the police regarding the alleged incident. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and she has given statement before the police as per Ex. P4 stating that she came to know the accused misbehaved with the victim girl and sexually harassed her. 13. Pw3 Balaram deposed in his evidence that victim girl is his sister's daughter. He has not given statement before the police that accused misbehaved with the victim girl. The said witness is also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that he has given statement before the police that he came to know that accused misbehaved with the Pw2 and sexually harassed her. 14. Pw4 Ravi Kumar who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex. P1 about one year back in Subramanyapura police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07. 11. 2014 at House No. 27, 1st floor, Byraveswara Nilaya, ABM colony, Bangalore and after knowing the contents of the mahazer, he has signed and deposing falsely. 15. Pw5 Annappa who is also mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he put his signature to mahazer Ex. P6 in the police station and not known the contents. He also treated as hostile witness by the prosecution and he denied that police drew the mahazer on 07. 11. 2014 at House No. 15, 2nd floor, Old Bank Colony, Rushyashrunga Road, Bangalore and seized the mobile. 16. Pw6 Manjuanth complainant deposed in his evidence that on 01. 11. 2014 at 5-00 p. m. , received the phone message from the public, it was attended by Idayith attender and on the same day at 6-00 p. m. , Idayith told that he received from phone message from the public with respect of sexual assault. On the next day, he went to the shop of the accused along with Akshitha and introduced as BEO Office officials came to enquire about the victim, as she has not attended the classes. Accused called his wife to bring the victim girl. Victim girl and her mother came at 12-20 p. m. , take away the victim girl in the Jeep and she disclosed the sexual assault by the accused since two years and also gave it in writing and reported the matter to the Director and Coordinator. Thereafter, lodged the complaint as per Ex. P7. 17. On perusal of the evidence of Pw1, Pw1 and Akshitha representing themselves that they are from BEO office had come to enquire about the victim girl, as why she has not attending the school regularly. Accused asked to bring the victim girl and victim girl was brought by her mother at 12-20 p. m. , and on enquiry the victim girl narrated the incident and also in writing as per Ex. P2. 18. It is clear from the records that case has been registered based on the complaint lodged by the complainant. It is the case of the complainant that he was not in the office while Idayith attender received the phone call. Idayith attender of Child Line is not examined by the prosecution. Pw6 also admits that they have maintained the registers for having received the phone calls from the public. It is clear from the evidence of Pw1 that immediately after he came to know about the incident, he has not reported the incident to the Special Juvenile Unit or the Local police U/Sec. 19(1)(a)(b) of POCSO Act 2012. Pw6 admits that he has not furnished the copy of the register maintained by them regarding phone call received in their office to the jurisdictional police. On perusal of the prosecution papers, Investigation Officer has not enquired Idayith attender of the Child Line who received the phone call from the public. On perusal of the evidence of Pw6, he lodged the complaint as per Ex. P7, after discussion with his superior officers and immediately he has not brought to the notice of the jurisdictional police with respect of the alleged incident. 19. The prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of Pw1 victim girl and she denied the incident in toto. She denied the sexual harassment by the accused and denied the contents of Ex. P1 and Ex. P2 is known to her. She denied that she has given complaint to the Child Line as per Ex. P2 and police drew mahazer on 07. 11. 2015. She also stated that Ex. P2 is not in her hand writing and she only signed and she does not know to read and write English and Kannada. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pw2 Bhavani Devi mother of the victim girl and Pw3 Balaram relative of the complainant. They have denied the incident and also denied that they have stated before the police as per Ex. P3 to Ex. P5. 20. Ex. P1 mahazer dated 07. 11. 2014 alleged to have been drawn in the house of the victim girl is not supported by the victim girl and Pw4 Ravi Kumar deposed that he has signed the mahazer in the police station. Ex. P6 mahazer dated 07. 11. 2014 is also not proved by the prosecution. Pw5 Annappa who is a mahazer witness deposed in his evidence that he has not known the contents of Ex. P6 and he put his signature about 6 months back at Subramanyapura police station and not known its contents. Hence, Ex. P7 mahazer is also not proved by the prosecution satisfactorily. 21. In an offence under section 376 of Indian Penal Code the evidence of the prosecution plays a vital role. The evidence of the victim girl can be accepted without there being corroboration. However, if there are any inconsistency or discrepancies in the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, then the court has to look for corroboration to the evidence of the victim girl, but the prosecution case is not supported by the evidence of the victim girl herself. 22. The prosecution case is also not supported by the evidence of Pws. 1 to 3 and mahazer witness Pw4 and Pw5. The Investigation Officer is also not examined. The mobile phone which accused used to show obscene videos to the victim girl is also not seized by the Investigation Officer. 23. Thus the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt on the part of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. Hence, in view of all these reasons, I answer point No. 1(a) to 1(d) in the negative. 24.

[case 10]
IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED: 27-04-2016 CORAM: THE HONOURABLE DR. JUSTICE P. DEVADASS Crl. M. P. No. 3669 of 2016 in Crl. A. No. 235 of 2016 Suresh. . Petitioner -vs- State Represented by The Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station-Udhagamandalam, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District. (Crime No. 1 of 2015). . Respondent Petition filed under Section 389(1) of Cr. P. C. , to suspend the sentence of imprisonment passed in Spl. S. C. No. 4 of 2015 dated 27. 11. 2015 by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Udhagamandalam, Nilgiris District and release the petitioner on bail pending disposal of the Criminal Appeal. For Petitioner: Mr. J. T. Rajasuriya For Respondent: Mr. P. Govindarajan, Additional Public Prosecutor. O R D E R The sole accused in the Special Sessions Case in Spl. S. C. No. 4 of 2015 on the file of the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fast Track Mahila Court, Nilgiris District at Udhagamandalam seeks suspension of his sentence of imprisonment. In the said Court, after trial, the trial Court convicted the accused under Section 7 read with Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter POCSO Act) and sentenced him 3 years R. I. and fined him Rs. 5, 000/- and directed him to pay a compensation of Rs. 1, 00, 000/-, i/d 2 years RI. The learned Judge also directed him payment of further compensation of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- out of Victim Assistance Fund. PW-2 is the daughter of PW-1. The accused has been prosecuted for he having sexually abused her. The Trial Court believed her and construed his act as a sexual assault and thus convicted and sentenced him as stated above. The learned counsel for the petitioner/appellant would contend that the petitioner as well as the accused fancied each other. They fell in love. To distance him from her daughter, PW-1 had engineered this case. The prosecution version is the concocted brainchild of PW-1 in an unholistic alliance with the obliging police. The learned counsel for the petitioner further contended that in this case the two instances of occurrence have been projected. However, on this aspect, there is material contradictions as between the mother (P. W. 1) and the daughter/P. W. 2. It is PW-1 vs. PW-2. The learned counsel for the petitioner would also contend that top of it, there is material variation in the testimony of PW-2 before and during trial. Before trial before a Magistrate under Section 164 Cr. P. C. So also in her police statement. P. Ws. -2 and 1 were inconsistent as to the alleged date of occurrence, more particularly, PW-1 introduces a date, namely, 5. 3. 2015 which is nobody's case. 5. 3. 2015 was not uttered either by PW-2 nor prosecution. Thus, PW-1's version is a coloured version. In such circumstances, placing implicit reliance on the testimony of PWs-1 and 2 and inflict punishment upon the accused is too dangerous. Thus, there is prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. He will not run away. He has no bad history/antecedents. In the circumstances, he may be granted appeal bail. On the other hand, the learned Additional Public Prosecutor would submit that the Court can keep aside PW-1 because she is not the victim and focus its attention mainly on the victim/PW-2. Her evidence is crystal clear that the accused prayed on PW-2 like a vulture. He committed the inhuman act upon a minor child. Her solemn statement as to the sexual violence committed upon her. There is no significant reason for PW-1 as against the accused to implicate the accused risking the life and future of unmarried school going minor daughter. Very grave allegations are made as against the accused. There is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. This case is not a fit case for the grant of appeal bail. I have anxiously considered the rival submissions, perused the Trial Court's judgment and the piece of evidence referred to by both sides. In the facts and circumstances, now the question is whether the petitioner could be granted appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr. P. C. Regular bail in a non-bailable offence in fit cases are being granted by the Magistrates under Section 437 Cr. P. C. While other Courts and the High Court exercises concurrent jurisdiction to grant bail in non-bailable cases under Section 439 Cr. P. C. The remand prisoners, under-trials could seek bail under the said provisions during pre-conviction stage of a criminal case. During that stage, it is pertinent to note that the presumption of innocence of an accused is intact because everyone is presumed to be innocent till the guilt alleged against the accused is proved beyond all reasonable doubts. However, once conviction is recorded, the said presumption is replaced by a Criminal Court judgment. Thereafter, also the conviction person can seek bail under Section 389 (1) Cr. P. C. Thus, the consideration for the grant of bail to an accused during the pre-conviction stage (before judgment) and post-conviction stage (after judgment) are different. So far as appeal bail under Section 389(1) Cr. P. C. is concerned, the Court has to find out is there any prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. While doing so, the Court should not indulge in meticulous examination of the evidence of the accused because the main appeal is not heard. It is still pending. To find out the prima facie case, the Trial Court has to refer to the findings recorded by the trial Court and the relevant evidence referred to. Further, it must also take into account the nature of the accusation made as against the accused. In view of the large scale violence committed upon the children, in 2012, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Act No. 32 of 2012) has been enacted. It is a Central Act. It contains provisions ensuring confidentiality of the victim of the offence, her family details and also conducting of the trial in a child friendly atmosphere and it had also introduced a legal fiction as to the criminal propensity, mental faculty of the accused, through Sections 29 and 30(1) of the Act. However, under Section 30(2), the Act one's right of presumption of innocence until he is otherwise held guilty by legal evidence has been preserved. Thus, it is Indianised version of admixture of English Criminal Law (Common System of Law) and French Criminal Law (Continental System of Law). Now, in a prosecution launched under POCSO Act, age of the victim is very important because only upon the victim being below 18 years that she is a 'child' the stringent provisions of POCSO Act will apply and consent of the victim being immaterial under POCSO Act. POCSO Act is much more wider in scope in prosecuting an accused than prosecuting accused under Section 376 IPC. In this case, start of the offence was stated to be on 21. 2. 2015 in the house of PW-1, when her mother was away. During that time, PW-2 was studying VIII Standard in a school. It is stated that then she was 13 years old. Ex. P-3 School Certificate, Ex. P-8 Medical Certificate, Ex. P-9 age Certificate and the evidence of PW-7 School Headmaster and PW-5 Doctor beyond pale of any controversy establishes that at the time when the alleged occurrence took place, she was below 18 years. So she is a child within the meaning of Section 2(d) of POCSO Act. So the provisions of POCSO Act became applicable to this case. PW-2 is stated to be the victim of a sexual violence. Her evidence shall be treated as the evidence of an injured witness. If her evidence is consistent, cogent, unimpeachable unless there is acceptable reasons to implicate the accused, her evidence can be acted upon. The question of looking for corroboration for her evidence arises when her evidence appears to be murky. This is a rule of prudence and not a rule of law. Thus, corroboration cannot be insisted upon as a condition precedent to act on the testimony of a victim in a sexual violence case. But while appreciating their evidence, the Court must fathom out the reality of the situation and the truth of the allegations. While doing so, the Court cannot mistake every difference in evidence as a material contradiction. It cannot go blow out a contradiction beyond proportion. It cannot mistook a mole a mountain. In a sexual violence case, honour of two persons, namely, the victim as well as the accused is involved. When the allegations are very serious, the Court must be very serious of proving those allegations. Even to impute culpable mental state to the accused, there must be some material for the Court to have reason to believe the existence of such a fact (See Sections 29 and 30(2) of POCSO Act, 2012). Now, in this case, PW-2 the minor child had the countenance of the accused, a Book-Seller for the first time when he came to their house to market his books. PW-1 forewarned him not to visit again since there are ladies in her house. According to PW-2, on the fateful day, namely, on 21. 2. 2015, at about 2 p. m. , while she was alone in her house, the accused came, pressed her breasts, pushed her to the bed, sexually abused her private parts by placing his private part. Subsequently, on 28. 3. 2015 around 2 p. m. , when again the accused came to her house with similar motive, PW-2 raised alarm, the accused took to his heels, PW-1 came, PW-2 recounted the whole incident and also the earlier incident that took place on 21. 2. 2015. Thereafter, police complaint was lodged. Thereafter, medical examination was conducted and there was no presence of external injuries on her private part. It is pertinent to note that the actual physical violence was not on 28. 3. 2015. Even as per the version of PW-2, it was on 21. 2. 2015 and thus, by the time the medical examination was conducted more than a month had passed away, the evidence on her person had fade away. PW-2, being a child was under extreme trauma, normally a child like her, when placed in such grim situation, will not be forthcoming and will try to hide the shame. But, in this case, as per PW-2 when again the accused attempted to make her sexual assault on her, unable to put up with the shame, she cried and the accused was caught. Reading the evidence of PWs-2 and 1 and other witnesses and the complaint, the substratum of the case that the accused on the first occasion had sexually assaulted the victim has been brought out by the prosecution. The attempt of the defence to dilute the effect of the said evidence by clinging to some difference in the evidence of PWs-1 and 2 and in the statement of the victim girl recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. which are not so material and are not significant enough to shake the veracity of the testimony of the victim girl has not been shattered by this adventure of the defence which has become a misadventure. Further, there is no convincing reason or motive supported by any material or acceptable reason to view the evidence of PW-2 with a jaundiced eye. The nature of the allegations made as against the accused is very serious. Thus, the fallout is that there is no prima facie case in favour of the petitioner. Thus, I am not inclined to grant him appeal bail. In view of the foregoings, this petition is dismissed. However, it is made clear that the observations made in this order are only for the purpose of finding out a prima facie case to take a decision in this petition and it has nothing to do with the disposal of the main Criminal Appeal. The Registrar (Judicial) is directed to make ready the booklet expeditiously as and when the appeal is ripe for disposal, it shall be included in the causelist under the caption 'Accused in Jail cases'.

NO. 378/2012 AND ETC. , THIS PETITION, COMING ON FOR FINAL HEARING, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING: -2- NC: 2024: KHC: 4254 CRL. RP No. 1073 of 2017 ORDER 1. This revision petition is arising out of the concurrent findings of the Courts below wherein the Trial Court recorded the conviction of the petitioner under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'). In the appeal, the Appellate Court allowed the appeal partly and set aside the judgment of conviction in respect of the provision under Section 504 of IPC and confirmed the sentences of the remaining provisions. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner herein has preferred this revision petition. 2. The rank of the parties in the Trial Court will be considered henceforth for convenience. Brief facts of the case are as under: 3. It is the case of the prosecution that, on 12. 12. 2011 at about 11. 00 a. m. , at Machihalli Koracharahatti village, Government Anganavadi school, when the complainant was discharging her duties as a Anganavadi Teacher, the accused went there and picked up quarrel with the complainant by stating that she should not have informed the marriage which he had intended to marry the minor girl, who is aged about 14 years, to the Women and Child Welfare Department, Harapanahalli. The accused abused in a filthy language and slapped her on the face and asked her to marry him and also assaulted her and pulled her saree and outraged her modesty. Further he has threatened her with dire consequences. Based on the complaint lodged by the complainant, the respondent / police have registered a case in Crime No. 175/2011 for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. After investigation, the respondent / police have submitted the charge sheet. 4. To prove the case of the prosecution, the prosecution examined 6 witnesses as PWs. 1 to 6 and got marked 7 documents as Exs. P1 to P7. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner committed the offences stated supra and recorded the conviction. Hence this revision petition. 5. Heard Shri R. B. Deshpande, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Rahul Rai K, learned High Court Government Pleader for the respondent - State. 6. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the concurrent findings recorded by the Courts below in convicting the petitioner / accused appears to be perverse, illegal and the same is liable to be set aside. 7. It is further submitted that there are no independent witnesses to the said incident. The complainant deliberately exaggerated the incident as if the petitioner has outraged her modesty and narrated in her complaint which is beyond truth. It is further submitted that the prosecution has not produced any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl. In the absence of the said document, it is not appropriate to arrive at a conclusion that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl / victim and the same was informed to the Women and Child Welfare Department. The said aspect should have been considered by the Courts below before recording the conviction. 8. It is further submitted that the Trial Court convicted the petitioner on the basis of the surmises and conjectures which are alien to the criminal jurisprudence. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Courts below are required to be set aside. Making such submission, learned counsel for the petitioner prays to allow the petition. 9. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader (for short 'HCGP) for the respondent-State vehemently justified the concurrent findings and submitted that the name of the victim with whom the marriage of the accused was proposed to be carried out, was studying at Kasturba Residential School and the said proposed marriage was informed to the complainant. After receiving the said information, the complainant has informed the same to the Women and Child Welfare Department. Due to the said enmity, the petitioner has committed the offences as stated supra. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner has committed the offences and therefore, interference with the said findings may not be appropriate and not required. Making such submission, learned HCGP prays to dismiss the petition. 10. Having heard the submissions of learned counsels for the respective parties and also perused the findings of the Courts below in recording the conviction, it is the case of the prosecution that the marriage between the petitioner and the minor girl was fixed and it was brought to the notice of PW. 1 by the villagers. The complainant has informed the said fact to the higher authority. The petitioner after having learnt that PW. 1 has informed the same to the higher officials, he has gone to the office of PW. 1 and started abusing, assaulting and insulting PW. 1 in one or other pretext and said to have committed the offences as stated supra. 11. Having regard to the scope and ambit of the Revisional jurisdiction in interfering with the findings of the Courts below, it is appropriate to have a cursory look upon the evidence of all the witnesses, to ascertain as to whether any error committed by the Courts below in appreciating both oral and documentary evidence on record. 12. PW. 1 being a Teacher who was working at Machihalli Anganvadi. On 12. 12. 2011, when she was working at the Anganvadi, she has learnt that the marriage of the minor girl was fixed with the petitioner and she had informed the same to the higher officials who visited the house of the victim / minor girl. Being enraged of the visit of the higher officials to the house of the minor girl, the petitioner went to Anganvadi Centre and questioned her as to why she has stopped the marriage and said to have pulled her saree, assaulted her in front of others. By that time, CW. 4 intervened and pacified the matter. Thereafter, PW. 1 went to the police station and lodged a complaint against the petitioner. She was cross-examined at length and she has admitted that she had not gone to the marriage negotiations proposed to be held between the petitioner and the minor girl. In spite of lengthy cross-examination being subjected to PW. 1, PW. 1 withstood the same and supported the case of the prosecution. 13. PW. 2 - an independent witness, supported the case of the prosecution and narrated the incident as how the petitioner had assaulted PW. 1 and the manner in which he has outraged her modesty. When a specific question was put to her that she is a relative of PW. 1, she has admitted the relationship. However, she has assertively stated that the incident had taken place in her presence and she has seen the assault having been made by the petitioner. 14. PW. 3 - witness to spot panchanama, which is marked as Ex. P2 and he has supported the case of the prosecution. 15. PW. 4 also witness to Ex. P2 and supported the case of the prosecution. 16. PW. 5 - Doctor who treated PW. 1, issued wound certificate as per Ex. P5. As per the said wound certificate, PW. 1 sustained three injuries. Though several suggestions are made about the methods and possibilities of sustaining the injuries, he has supported the case of the prosecution. 17. PW. 6 was working as PSI, stated to have received the complaint on 12. 12. 2011 and conducted the investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 18. As per the averments of the complaint and also the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2, the incident said to have taken place on 12. 12. 2011, on the same day, a complaint came to be registered by the complainant. The FIR was sent to the Jurisdictional Magistrate on the same date at 05. 20 p. m. The evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 are clinching and reliable. These two witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross-examination; however, nothing has been elicited to disbelieve their version. In addition to their evidence, the evidence of the Doctor - PW. 5 who treated PW. 1 and issued wound certificate as per Ex. P5 which clearly indicates that PW. 1 sustained injuries. The incident had taken place when she was discharging her official duty as Anganvadi Teacher. 19. The prosecution even though examined PWs. 1 and 2 as witnesses to the incident, no independent witnesses have neither been cited nor examined as witnesses to the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the alleged incident said to have taken place in the village, if such incident had taken place in the Anganavadi, certainly many people would have gathered, either to witness the incident or to pacify the same. Not citing the independent witnesses in such incident by the Investigating Officer, which appears to be strange and unbelievable. 20. The motive for the said incident is that PW. 1 has informed to the higher officials regarding the proposed marriage of the petitioner with a minor girl. The prosecution has failed to produce any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl and further the prosecution failed to cite the officials of the Department of Women and Child Welfare to substantiate the case. When the prosecution has failed to establish the motive for commission of such offence, the commission of offence appears to be doubtful and it may be said that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and therefore, the petitioner is entitled for acquittal in this case. However, the Courts below have failed to take note of these aspects and recorded the conviction which appears to be erroneous and not proper. Therefore, the conviction has to be set aside. 21. In the light of the above observations, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER (i) The Criminal Revision Petition is allowed. (ii) The judgment and order dated 11. 07. 2013 passed in CC. No. 378/2012 by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Harapanahalli and the judgment and order dated 21. 07. 2017 passed in Crl. A. No. 78/2013 by the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Davanagere are set aside. (iii) The petitioner is acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. (iv) Bail bonds executed, if any, stand cancelled. Sd/- JUDGE BSS List No. : 1 Sl No. : 49

This revision petition is arising out of the concurrent findings of the Courts below wherein the Trial Court recorded the conviction of the petitioner under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC'). In the appeal, the Appellate Court allowed the appeal partly and set aside the judgment of conviction in respect of the provision under Section 504 of IPC and confirmed the sentences of the remaining provisions. Being aggrieved by the same, the petitioner herein has preferred this revision petition. 2. The rank of the parties in the Trial Court will be considered henceforth for convenience. Brief facts of the case are as under: 3. It is the case of the prosecution that, on 12. 12. 2011 at about 11. 00 a. m. , at Machihalli Koracharahatti village, Government Anganavadi school, when the complainant was discharging her duties as a Anganavadi Teacher, the accused went there and picked up quarrel with the complainant by stating that she should not have informed the marriage which he had intended to marry the minor girl, who is aged about 14 years, to the Women and Child Welfare Department, Harapanahalli. The accused abused in a filthy language and slapped her on the face and asked her to marry him and also assaulted her and pulled her saree and outraged her modesty. Further he has threatened her with dire consequences. Based on the complaint lodged by the complainant, the respondent / police have registered a case in Crime No. 175/2011 for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. After investigation, the respondent / police have submitted the charge sheet. 4. To prove the case of the prosecution, the prosecution examined 6 witnesses as PWs. 1 to 6 and got marked 7 documents as Exs. P1 to P7. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner committed the offences stated supra and recorded the conviction. Hence this revision petition. 5. Heard Shri R. B. Deshpande, learned counsel for the petitioner and Shri Rahul Rai K, learned High Court Government Pleader for the respondent - State. 6. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that, the concurrent findings recorded by the Courts below in convicting the petitioner / accused appears to be perverse, illegal and the same is liable to be set aside. 7. It is further submitted that there are no independent witnesses to the said incident. The complainant deliberately exaggerated the incident as if the petitioner has outraged her modesty and narrated in her complaint which is beyond truth. It is further submitted that the prosecution has not produced any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl. In the absence of the said document, it is not appropriate to arrive at a conclusion that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl / victim and the same was informed to the Women and Child Welfare Department. The said aspect should have been considered by the Courts below before recording the conviction. 8. It is further submitted that the Trial Court convicted the petitioner on the basis of the surmises and conjectures which are alien to the criminal jurisprudence. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Courts below are required to be set aside. Making such submission, learned counsel for the petitioner prays to allow the petition. 9. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader (for short 'HCGP) for the respondent-State vehemently justified the concurrent findings and submitted that the name of the victim with whom the marriage of the accused was proposed to be carried out, was studying at Kasturba Residential School and the said proposed marriage was informed to the complainant. After receiving the said information, the complainant has informed the same to the Women and Child Welfare Department. Due to the said enmity, the petitioner has committed the offences as stated supra. Both the Courts have concurrently held that the petitioner has committed the offences and therefore, interference with the said findings may not be appropriate and not required. Making such submission, learned HCGP prays to dismiss the petition. 10. Having heard the submissions of learned counsels for the respective parties and also perused the findings of the Courts below in recording the conviction, it is the case of the prosecution that the marriage between the petitioner and the minor girl was fixed and it was brought to the notice of PW. 1 by the villagers. The complainant has informed the said fact to the higher authority. The petitioner after having learnt that PW. 1 has informed the same to the higher officials, he has gone to the office of PW. 1 and started abusing, assaulting and insulting PW. 1 in one or other pretext and said to have committed the offences as stated supra. 11. Having regard to the scope and ambit of the Revisional jurisdiction in interfering with the findings of the Courts below, it is appropriate to have a cursory look upon the evidence of all the witnesses, to ascertain as to whether any error committed by the Courts below in appreciating both oral and documentary evidence on record. 12. PW. 1 being a Teacher who was working at Machihalli Anganvadi. On 12. 12. 2011, when she was working at the Anganvadi, she has learnt that the marriage of the minor girl was fixed with the petitioner and she had informed the same to the higher officials who visited the house of the victim / minor girl. Being enraged of the visit of the higher officials to the house of the minor girl, the petitioner went to Anganvadi Centre and questioned her as to why she has stopped the marriage and said to have pulled her saree, assaulted her in front of others. By that time, CW. 4 intervened and pacified the matter. Thereafter, PW. 1 went to the police station and lodged a complaint against the petitioner. She was cross-examined at length and she has admitted that she had not gone to the marriage negotiations proposed to be held between the petitioner and the minor girl. In spite of lengthy cross-examination being subjected to PW. 1, PW. 1 withstood the same and supported the case of the prosecution. 13. PW. 2 - an independent witness, supported the case of the prosecution and narrated the incident as how the petitioner had assaulted PW. 1 and the manner in which he has outraged her modesty. When a specific question was put to her that she is a relative of PW. 1, she has admitted the relationship. However, she has assertively stated that the incident had taken place in her presence and she has seen the assault having been made by the petitioner. 14. PW. 3 - witness to spot panchanama, which is marked as Ex. P2 and he has supported the case of the prosecution. 15. PW. 4 also witness to Ex. P2 and supported the case of the prosecution. 16. PW. 5 - Doctor who treated PW. 1, issued wound certificate as per Ex. P5. As per the said wound certificate, PW. 1 sustained three injuries. Though several suggestions are made about the methods and possibilities of sustaining the injuries, he has supported the case of the prosecution. 17. PW. 6 was working as PSI, stated to have received the complaint on 12. 12. 2011 and conducted the investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 18.

Being enraged of the visit of the higher officials to the house of the minor girl, the petitioner went to Anganvadi Centre and questioned her as to why she has stopped the marriage and said to have pulled her saree, assaulted her in front of others. By that time, CW. 4 intervened and pacified the matter. Thereafter, PW. 1 went to the police station and lodged a complaint against the petitioner. She was cross-examined at length and she has admitted that she had not gone to the marriage negotiations proposed to be held between the petitioner and the minor girl. In spite of lengthy cross-examination being subjected to PW. 1, PW. 1 withstood the same and supported the case of the prosecution. 13. PW. 2 - an independent witness, supported the case of the prosecution and narrated the incident as how the petitioner had assaulted PW. 1 and the manner in which he has outraged her modesty. When a specific question was put to her that she is a relative of PW. 1, she has admitted the relationship. However, she has assertively stated that the incident had taken place in her presence and she has seen the assault having been made by the petitioner. 14. PW. 3 - witness to spot panchanama, which is marked as Ex. P2 and he has supported the case of the prosecution. 15. PW. 4 also witness to Ex. P2 and supported the case of the prosecution. 16. PW. 5 - Doctor who treated PW. 1, issued wound certificate as per Ex. P5. As per the said wound certificate, PW. 1 sustained three injuries. Though several suggestions are made about the methods and possibilities of sustaining the injuries, he has supported the case of the prosecution. 17. PW. 6 was working as PSI, stated to have received the complaint on 12. 12. 2011 and conducted the investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 18. As per the averments of the complaint and also the evidence of PWs. 1 and 2, the incident said to have taken place on 12. 12. 2011, on the same day, a complaint came to be registered by the complainant. The FIR was sent to the Jurisdictional Magistrate on the same date at 05. 20 p. m. The evidence of PWs. 1 and 2 are clinching and reliable. These two witnesses have been subjected to lengthy cross-examination; however, nothing has been elicited to disbelieve their version. In addition to their evidence, the evidence of the Doctor - PW. 5 who treated PW. 1 and issued wound certificate as per Ex. P5 which clearly indicates that PW. 1 sustained injuries. The incident had taken place when she was discharging her official duty as Anganvadi Teacher. 19. The prosecution even though examined PWs. 1 and 2 as witnesses to the incident, no independent witnesses have neither been cited nor examined as witnesses to the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the alleged incident said to have taken place in the village, if such incident had taken place in the Anganvadi, certainly many people would have gathered, either to witness the incident or to pacify the same. Not citing the independent witnesses in such incident by the Investigating Officer, which appears to be strange and unbelievable. 20. The motive for the said incident is that PW. 1 has informed to the higher officials regarding the proposed marriage of the petitioner with a minor girl. The prosecution has failed to produce any document to show that the marriage was fixed between the petitioner and the minor girl and further the prosecution failed to cite the officials of the Department of Women and Child Welfare to substantiate the case. When the prosecution has failed to establish the motive for commission of such offence, the commission of offence appears to be doubtful and it may be said that the prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond all reasonable doubt and therefore, the petitioner is entitled for acquittal in this case. However, the Courts below have failed to take note of these aspects and recorded the conviction which appears to be erroneous and not proper. Therefore, the conviction has to be set aside. 21. In the light of the above observations, I proceed to pass the following: ORDER (i) The Criminal Revision Petition is allowed. (ii) The judgment and order dated 11. 07. 2013 passed in CC. No. 378/2012 by the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Harapanahalli and the judgment and order dated 21. 07. 2017 passed in Crl. A. No. 78/2013 by the I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Davanagere are set aside. (iii) The petitioner is acquitted for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 323, 353, 354, 506 of IPC. (iv) Bail bonds executed, if any, stand cancelled. Sd/- JUDGE BSS List No. : 1 Sl No. : 49

THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON
31. 05. 2021, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY DELIVERED THE
BAIL APPL. NO. 3485 OF 2021 2
This application is filed under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C.
2. The applicant is the sole accused in S. C. No. 629 of 2020 on the
file of the Special Court for trial of offences relating to atrocities against
women and children including POCSO cases, Additional Sessions Court 1,
Alappuzha registered under Sections 363, 370, 342, 376AB, 354 A of the
Indian Penal Code and under Sections 4 r/w 3(a), 5(m) r/w 6(1), 8 r/w 7,
10 r/w 9 (l) & (m) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
3. A minor child aged about 4½ years is the victim in the instant
case. The prosecution allegation is that on 30. 8. 2020 at noon, the
applicant, with intent to commit sexual assault of the minor child, entered
the house of the child and kissed her. Later on 31. 8. 2020 at about 9. 45
am, the applicant is alleged to have taken the child to the rear side of the
building No XXII/530 of Alappuzha Municipality and subjected the child to
penetrative sexual abuse.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that
the applicant was arrested in connection with the aforesaid crime on
31. 8. 2020 and he has been in judicial custody since then. According to
BAIL APPL. NO. 3485 OF 2021 3
the learned counsel there is some delay in setting the law in motion which
renders the whole prosecution version on suspicion. It is further
submitted that now that the final report has been laid, further detention in
custody is unwarranted.
5. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions submitted that the
investigation conducted would disclose that a child of tender age was
subjected to penetrative sexual abuse by the applicant. Referring to the
medical records, it was contended that the allegation is clearly
substantiated by the injuries noted by the doctor. The severity of the
allegations is highlighted by the learned Public Prosecutor to persuade this
Court to refuse bail to the applicants.
6. The principles, which the Court must consider while granting or
declining bail, have been stated by the Apex Court in a catena of cases. In
Prahlad Singh Bhati v. NCT, Delhi [(2001) 4 SCC 280], it was held
"The jurisdiction to grant bail has to be exercised on
the basis of well-settled principles having regard to
the circumstances of each case and not in an
arbitrary manner. While granting the bail, the court
has to keep in mind the nature of accusations, the
nature of the evidence in support thereof, the
severity of the punishment which conviction will
entail, the character, behaviour, means and standing
of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to
BAIL APPL. NO. 3485 OF 2021 4
the accused, reasonable possibility of securing the
presence of the accused at the trial, reasonable
apprehension of the witnesses being tampered with,
the larger interests of the public or State and similar
other considerations. It has also to be kept in mind
that for the purposes of granting the bail the
legislature has used the words "reasonable grounds
for believing" instead of "the evidence" which means
the court dealing with the grant of bail can only
satisfy itself as to whether there is a genuine case
against the accused and that the prosecution will be
able to produce prima facie evidence in support of
the charge. It is not expected, at this stage, to have
the evidence establishing the guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt. "

Smt. Tammanna And Another vs State Of U. P. And 5 Others on 30 July, 2019
? Court No. - 42
Case: - HABEAS CORPUS WRIT PETITION No. - 723 of 2019
Petitioner: - Smt. Tammanna And Another
Respondent: - State Of U. P. And 5 Others
Counsel for Petitioner: - Ved Mani Sharma
Counsel for Respondent: - G. A.
Hon'ble Manoj Misra, J.
Hon'ble Virendra Kumar Srivastava, J.
Heard learned counsel for the petitioners; the learned A. G. A. for the respondents 1 to 5; and perused the record.
This habeas corpus petition has been filed with multiple prayers, one of them is that a writ in the nature of certiorari be issued quashing the order dated 06. 07. 2019 passed by the Child Welfare Committee, Shahjahanpur by which the corpus Tammanna has been placed in the care and protection of Children Protection Home (Girls), Hathaura Bujurg, Shahjahanpur.
A perusal of the record would reveal that Case Crime No. 149 of 2019 was registered at P. S. Jalalabad, District Shahjahanpur, under Sections 363, 366 I. P. C. and section 7/8 Pocso Act on the FIR lodged by Asif (respondent no. 6), father of the corpus, wherein it was alleged that Tamanna (minor daughter of the informant) was enticed away by accused persons including the petitioner no. 2. The corpus was recovered and produced before the Child Welfare Committee. The Child Welfare Committee found that the educational certificate of the victim disclosed her date of birth as 08. 05. 2003 though medical examination of the victim suggested that she was above 18 years. The Child Welfare Committee accorded primacy to the date of birth entered in the educational certificate and, as the victim had refused to go with her parents, directed her placement in the Child Protection Home (girls) in exercise of power conferred by Section 37 (1)(c) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (for short J. J. Act, 2015)
Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that in a Criminal Misc. Writ Petition No. 9222 of 2019, the arrest of the accused (petitioner no. 2) has been stayed after considering the statement of the victim and the date of birth in her adhar card as per which she is an adult.
Learned A. G. A. has submitted that entry of date of birth entered in the adhar card is not conclusive with regard to its holder and as the age of a child victim is to be determined by applying the principles embodied in Section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015, under which, primacy is to be accorded to date of birth entered in educational certificate over medical evidence, the order of the Child Welfare Committee is not illegal or perverse so as to warrant issuance of writ of habeas corpus or to invoke the writ jurisdiction, particularly, when alternative remedy is available under Section 101 of the J. J. Act, 2015.
Having noticed the rival submissions, before we proceed to address the issues, it would be apposite to observe that the Apex Court had consistently been of the view that the principles applicable for determining the age of juvenile in conflict with law are to be applied for determining the age of child victim (vide Jarnail Singh Vs. State of Haryana, (2013) 7 SCC 263; State of M. P. Vs. Anoop Singh, (2015) 7 SCC 773; and Mahadeo Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2013) 14 SCC 637).
Section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015 provides for presumption and determination of age. Sub-section (2) of section 94 of the J. J. Act, 2015, which is relevant, is extracted below:
"(2) In case, the Committee or the Board has reasonable grounds for doubt regarding whether the person brought before it is a child or not, the Committee or the Board, as the case may be, shall undertake the process of age determination, by seeking evidence by obtaining--
(i) the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, if available; and in the absence thereof;
(ii) the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;
(iii) and only in the absence of (i) and (ii) above, age shall be determined by an ossification test or any other latest medical age determination test conducted on the orders of the Committee or the Board:
Provided such age determination test conducted on the order of the Committee or the Board shall be completed within fifteen days from the date of such order. "
From above, it is clear that primacy is to be accorded to the date of birth certificate from the school, or the matriculation or equivalent certificate from the concerned examination Board, and, in the absence thereof, to the birth certificate given by a corporation or municipality or panchayat. Only in absence of above evidence, medical evidence is to be taken.
Section 37 (1) (c) of the J. J. Act, 2015 empowers the Child Welfare Committee to place a child in need of care and protection in a Children's Home or fit facility for temporary care.
Section 2 (14) of the J. J. Act, 2015 defines a child in need of care and protection. Clauses (iii), (viii) (xii) of sub-section (14) of Section 2 of the J. J. Act, 2015 are relevant for the purpose of deciding this case. The said clauses along with the opening part of sub-section (14) of section 2 of the J. J. Act, 2015 are extracted below:
"Section 2(14) "child in need of care and protection" means a child--
(iii) who resides with a person (whether a guardian of the child or not) and such person--
(a) has injured, exploited, abused or neglected the child or has violated any other law for the time being in force meant for the protection of child; or
(b) has threatened to kill, injure, exploit or abuse the child and there is a reasonable likelihood of the threat being carried out; or
(c) has killed, abused, neglected or exploited some other child or children and there is a reasonable likelihood of the child in question being killed, abused, exploited or neglected by that person; or

Madhya Pradesh High Court Nikhil Sarathe vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 August, 2018 1 M. Cr. C. No. 16856 of 2017 HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH PRINCIPAL SEAT AT JABALPUR Single Bench: Hon'ble Shri Rajeev Kumar Dubey, J. Misc. Criminal Case No. 16856/2017 Nikhil Sarathe vs. State of M. P. and Others -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shri Alok Bagrecha and Shri Pushpendra Dubey, learned counsel for the applicant. Shri Manish Awasthi, Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State. Shri Vivek Agrawal, learned counsel for the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix. None for the respondent No. 3/complainant though served. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORDER Reserved on: 21/08/2018 Delivered on: /08/2018 This petition has been filed under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. seeking quashing of the F. I. R. of crime No. 293/2016 registered at PS Kotwali Bhopal for the offence punishable under Sections 363, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4 of POCSO Act and consequential proceedings thereto. Brief facts of the case are that on 29/12/2016, the father of the prosecutrix lodged a report at P. S. Kotwali Bhopal averring that his daughter (prosecutrix) age about 17 years was not at home since six 'o'clock in the morning and she was not found even after enough search. Someone had abducted her. On that police registered crime No. 293/16 for the offence punishable under section 363 of I. P. C. and investigated the matter and during investigation on 23/01/17 police rescued the prosecutrix from the custody of applicant and recorded the statement of the prosecutrix. In her statement prosecutrix stated that she had known applicant Nikhil for the last five years and there was a love affair between them. On 29th December 2016, Nikhil had asked him to escape from the house in order to marry with him. On this, around 5-6 o'clock in the morning without informing her family members she went to the Hawa Mahal, where she met Nikhil who took her to Arya Samaj Mandir situated at Nehru Nagar, where both of them got married, then they went to Shirdi where they stayed for four or five days. Thereafter they came back to Bhopal and stayed there for 5-6 days at Nikhil's friend's house situated at Neelbad area in Bhopal. During that period Nikhil also made physical relationship with her, after which Nikhil's friend Shubham (co-accused) took them to Jabalpur, where they stayed in the house of a person, who happened to be an acquaintance of Shubham, as a guest for 6-7 days. There too applicant Nikhil Had sex with her four to five times. On that police also added offences under section 368, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 (i) and 12 of POCSO Act and after investigation of the crime police filed charge-sheet against the applicant. On that charge-sheet S. T. No. 28/18 was registered. Applicant is facing trial in that case before 7 th A. S. J. Bhopal and filed this petition for quashing the F. I. R. of the crime No. 293/16 registered at P. S. Kotwali Bhopal and the proceedings of S. T. No. 28/18. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with the applicant on her own will. In the birth certificate of the prosecutrix, her date of birth is mentioned as 30/11/1998. According to that certificate, prosecutrix was major at the time of incident. The prosecutrix in her statement recorded by the JMFC under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. also deposed that she went with the applicant at her own will and she had married with applicant and is living with him. Since prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with applicant own her on will, no offences under Section 363, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4 of POCSO Act is made out against the applicant. He further submitted that if it is assumed that the age of the prosecutrix was 17 years two months at the time of incident as appears on the basis of school entry register produced by the prosecution along with the charge sheet even then no offence is made out against the applicant from the charge-sheet because prosecutrix went with the applicant on her own will. In this regard, he also placed reliance on Delhi High Court judgment passed in Laxmi Devi & Anr. ; Maha Dev & Devender @ Babli v. State reported in (2012) DLT 619 and Apex Court judgment passed in Satish Mehra Vs. State reported in 2013 CrLJ 411, Rajeev Thaper Vs. Madan Lal reported in (2013) 3 SCC 330 and Independent thought Vs. Union of India reported in (2017) 10 SCC 800, and State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy and others reported in 1977 CRLJ 1125. Learned counsel for the prosecutrix also submitted that prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with the applicant on her own will and at present she is living with the applicant and also married with the him, so offence registered against the applicant should be quashed. Learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer and submitted that according to school entry register the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 23/10/1999 and on that basis the age of the prosecutrix was below 18 years at the time of incident i. e. 29/12/16 and she was minor at the time of incident. Applicant abducted the prosecutrix and made sexual relations with her, so offence under Section 368, 376 of IPC and Section 3/ 4 and 12 of POCSO is clearly made out against the applicant and prays for rejection of petition. This Court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the learned counsel for both the parties. In the entry of school register, the date of prosecutrix is mentioned 23/10/1999 and on that basis the age of the prosecutrix appears to be below 18 years at the time of incident i. e. 29/12/16 and she was minor at the time of incident. Applicant took the prosecutrix and made sexual relations with her. Although applicant produced Birth certificate of the prosecutrix in which the date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 30/11/1998 but authenticity of that certificate has to be tested and it requires evidence to decide. So at this stage only on that basis it can not be said that prosecutrix was major at the time of incident. Fact of the cases relied on by the learned counsel of the applicant do not match with the instant case. The case Laxmi Devi & Anr. ; Maha Dev & Devender @ Babli v. State (supra) relate to the incidents that occurred before November 2012 when POCSO Act was not in force. While this incident occurred on 29/12/2016 when POCSO Act had come into force and according to section 3 of the POCSO Act intercourse with a woman below 18 years of age is the offence irrespective of the fact that she is a wife of accused. in the case of Satish Mehra v. State (NCT of Delhi), (Supra) apex court held "charge sheet only quashed if the attending facts and circumstances satisfy the narrow test that even accepting all the allegations levelled by the prosecution, no offence is disclosed. While in this case offence under POCSO Act is prima facie made out against applicant. Because on the basis of school entry register and the statement of parents of the prosecutrix her age appeared to be below 18 years. In the case of Rajeev Thaper Vs. Madan Lal (supra) apex court held "To invoke its inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 CrPC, the High Court has to be fully satisfied that the material produced by the accused is such that would lead to the conclusion that his/their defence is based on sound, reasonable, and indubitable facts; but the material relied upon by the accused should be of sterling and impeccable quality. " While in this case the authenticity of birth certificate of the prosecutrix has to be proved which requires evidence. On the other hand prosecution produced entry of school admission register to prove the age of prosecutrix in which date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 23/10/1999. In the case of Independent thought Vs. Union of India (Supra) apex court held that Exception 2 to Section 375 I. P. C. in so far as it relates to a girl child below 18 years is liable to be struck down on the following grounds: - (i) it is arbitrary, capricious, whimsical and violative of the rights of the girl child and not fair, just and reasonable and, therefore, violative of Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Constitution of India. In the case of State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy and others (supra) Apex court held that High Court is entitled to quash a proceeding if it comes to conclusion that allowing the proceeding to continue would be an abuse of the process of the court or that the ends of the justice requires that the preceding out to quashed. While in this case if it is proved that prosecutrix was below 18 years of age at the time of incident, there is sufficient evidence to proceed against the applicant in the case. So these judgements do not help applicant much. Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Yogendra Yadav and others vs. State of Jharkhand and another (2014) 9 SCC 653 held that offences which involve moral turpitude, grave offences like rape murder cannot be effaced by quashing proceedings under section 482 because they have harmful effect on society and are not restricted to two individuals or group quashing of such offences may send a wrong signal to society. In the case in hand prosecution produced the entry of school register along with charge sheet in which date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned 23/10/1999 and on that basis the age of the prosecutrix appears to be below 18 years at the time of incident i. e. 29/12/16 and she was minor at the time of incident. Applicant took the prosecutrix along with him and made sexual relations with her. So from the charge sheet offence under section 3/4 of the POCSO Act is prima facie made out against the applicant. So FIR and the proceedings of S. T. No. 28/18 can not be quashed at this stage. Although applicant produced Birth certificate of the prosecutrix in which the date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 30/11/1998 but authenticity of that certificate has to be tested and it requires evidence to decide. Applicant is free to raise this issue before trial court at the appropriate stage and produce the evidence in support of his defence which will consider by the trial court on merits. Accordingly, petition is disposed of. (Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge vs Digitally signed by VARSHA SINGH Date: 2018. 08. 29 17: 55: 33 +05'30'

JAYACHANDRAN, J. ------------------------------------ Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 ------------------------------------ Dated, this the 21st day of February, 2025 ORDER The petitioners herein are the accused persons in Crime no. 811/2021 of Binanipuram Police Station (Annexure-I), now pending as C. C. No. 29/2022 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Aluva. The petitioners seek quashment of the said crime and all further proceedings therein. 2. Heard the learned Counsel for the petitioners and the learned Public Prosecutor. Perused the records. 3. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that, the 1st petitioner is the legally wedded wife of one Pramod, who is the son of the defacto complainant in the instant crime. There were matrimonial disputes and due to harassment, the 1st petitioner/1st accused left the matrimonial home and started residing in her parental home. Petitioners 2 and 3 are her father and brother respectively, who were accused nos. 2 and 3 in the subject Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 2025: KER: 15509 -4- crime. The 1st petitioner got information that during the subsistence of marriage with her, her husband Pramod is going to remarry. Accordingly, she lodged Annexure-V complaint before the jurisdictional Police, seeking police protection, so as to enable her to go back to the matrimonial home and reside there. Accordingly, on 06. 07. 2021, at 2 p. m, the petitioners reached the matrimonial home, where she was cruelly manhandled by the present defacto complainant, her husband and neighbours. A case has been registered in respect of the incident as Crime no. 810/2021 (Annexure-VII). According to the learned Counsel, the instant crime bearing no. 811/2021 is a counter blast to the same. It was also pointed out that the allegations leveled in the F. I. S. are trivial in nature, as against the 1st accused. There is no allegation, whatsoever, as against accused nos. 2 and 3 (petitioners 2 and 3), except that they have not opposed the acts of the 1st petitioner/1st accused. Learned Counsel would submit that, a perusal of Annexure-VII F. I. R. would indicate that it was the petitioners herein, who were abused and manhandled by the defacto complainant and others. Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 2025: KER: 15509 -5- 4. This application was seriously opposed by the learned Public Prosecutor. 5. Having heard the learned Counsel appearing for the respective parties, this Court finds that the Crl. M. C. is liable to be allowed in part, as against petitioners 2 and 3. This Court perused the F. I. S. , which forms part of Annexure-I F. I. R. The allegations constituting the crime are extracted here below: "ഇന്നലെ (06. 11. 2009) തിയതി ഉച്ചയ്ക്ക് രണ്ടു മണിയോടെ മഹാലക്ഷ്മിയും കുട്ടിയും അമ്മയും, സഹോദരനും ഞങ്ങളുടെ വീട്ടിൽ വന്നു. ഞങ്ങൾ കാര്യങ്ങൾ തിരക്കിയപ്പോൾ എനിക്കിവിടെ താമസിക്കുമെന്ന് പറഞ്ഞു ബാഗും സാധനങ്ങളും മഹാലക്ഷ്മി വീടിന് അകത്തു വച്ചു. അപ്പോൾ ഞാൻ ഇത്രയും നാൾ ഇവിടെ താമസിക്കാത്തതിനാൽ അവളുടെ സാധനങ്ങൾ പുറത്തു വെച്ചു. ഞാൻ കാര്യങ്ങൾ പറയുന്നത് കൊണ്ടിരുന്നപ്പോൾ മഹാലക്ഷ്മി എൻ്റെ കൈയ്യിൽ ബലമായി പിടിച്ച് നിർത്തി എന്നെയും ഇളയ മകൻ ശ്രീമോനെയും തള്ളി താഴെ ഇട്ടു. താഴെ വീണതിൽ വെച്ച് എനിക്ക് നടുവിന് വേദനയും മറ്റും ഉണ്ടായതിനെ തുടർന്ന് ഞാനും മകനും ആലുവ ഗവൺമെൻറ് ആശുപത്രിയിൽ ചികിത്സയ്ക് പോയി ഡോക്ടർ പരിശോധന ചെയ്തപ്പോൾ ഞങ്ങൾക്കു മരുന്ന് തന്നാൾ വീട്ടിലേക്ക് ‌ അയച്ചു. മഹാലക്ഷ്മിയും ഞാനും മുറ്റത്തു നിന്ന് സംസാരിക്കുന്നത് കണ്ട് മഹാ ലക്ഷ്മിയുടെ അച്ഛനും സഹോദരനും കയറി വന്നു അവളെ അനുകൂലിച്ച് സംസാരിച്ചു. " Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 2025: KER: 15509 -6- 6. It could be seen from the above that the solitary allegation against the petitioners 2 and 3 (accused nos. 2 and 3) is that, they spoke in support of the 1 st accused/1st petitioner. The offences alleged are under Sections 323, 447, 341, read with Section 34 of the Penal code. This Court fails to understand as to how the Investigating Officer has concluded, on the basis of the above referred solitary statement contained in the F. I. S. , that accused nos. 2 and 3 have committed the offences alleged. This Court cannot, but observe that the Investigating Officer was so casual in arriving at the complicity of petitioners 2 and 3 (accused nos. 2 and 3). There exists no material, which would tend to implicate the said persons. It may have to be observed that the Investigating Officer has acted in tune with the sinister motive of the defacto complainant, insofar as their allegations against petitioners 2 and 3 are concerned. Thinking from another angle, the mischief is done by the Investigating Officer; and not by the defacto complainant. The defacto complainant has only stated the true facts. It was for the Investigating Officer to arrive at a conclusion that such allegation that petitioners 2 and 3 spoke in favour of A1 (daughter of A2 and sister of A3) was only a natural reaction, incapable of constituting any crime as alleged. 7. The outcome of the above discussion is that the proceedings against petitioners 2 and 3 vide Crime no. 811/2024 - now pending as C. C. no. 29/2022 before the Judicial First Class Magistrate Court-II, Aluva - cannot be sustained. The same is hereby quashed. 8. Coming to 1st petitioner/1st accused, there is an allegation that she caught hold of the hand of the defacto complainant and pushed down herself and her son Pramod. This Court is not in a position to ascertain the veracity of the submission that the said allegations, as also, the instant crime, is only a counter blast to Annexure-VII crime. That is a matter which has to be evolved during the course of evidence. In the circumstances, the prayer sought for, insofar as the 1 st petitioner/1st accused is concerned, cannot be allowed and the Crl. M. C. will stand dismissed as against the 1st petitioner/1st accused. However, the same will stand allowed, as already indicated, against petitioners 2 and 3. 9. Learned Counsel for the petitioners submits that, the 1st petitioner/1st accused is having a child, aged ten years and her personal appearance may be exempted, except for crucial dates. The said relief is only to be allowed. Accordingly, the personal appearance of the 1st petitioner/1st accused will stand exempted. However, during the course of trial, the 1 st petitioner/1st accused shall be present. On any other date, if the 1st petitioner's presence is found necessary, the learned Magistrate will notify the same, on which date the 1st petitioner/1st accused shall be present. With the above directions, the Crl. M. C. will stand disposed of. Sd/- C. JAYACHANDRAN JUDGE SKP/24-02 Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 2025: KER: 15509 -9- APPENDIX OF CRL.

[case 21]
This application under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. / 528 of BNSS has been filed seeking quashment of FIR in Crime No. 273/2019 registered at Police Station Mahila Thana, Gwalior for offence under Sections 498-A, 506 and 34 of IPC and under Section 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act. It is submitted by counsel for the applicants that charge-sheet has been filed and on one occasion although the complainant was present but her evidence could not be recorded at the request of counsel for the applicants. According to prosecution case the respondent No. 2 lodged an FIR on 15/11/2019 alleging inter alia that she got married to the applicant No. 1 on 7/5/2014 in accordance with Hindu rites and rituals. At the time of her marriage, her father had given sufficient dowry including household articles and gold ornaments as per the demand raised by the applicants. In all approximately an amount of Rs. 22 lacs was spent. A car was also given which is still in possession of the applicants. Applicants were not happy with the articles which were given in dowry and therefore they started harassing her physically and mentally by alleging that less dowry and less cash amount has been given. Applicant No. 2 was posted as a Deputy Ranger in Forest Department, whereas, applicant No. 3 is a housewife. They used to pass taunts frequently on the ground that she has come from the house of a beggar and sufficient dowry has not been given. They were demanding Rs. 5 lacs and a gold chain of 3 Tolas. However, she continued to live in her matrimonial house in spite of mental harassment and cruelty and she gave birth to a girl child on 5/9/2015. All the delivery expenses were borne by her father and now the applicants have kept the daughter with them against the wishes of respondent No. 2 and they are not permitting her to meet with her. A lot of efforts were made for compromise and accordingly out of love and affection towards her daughter, she went to her matrimonial house on 29/9/2019; where, the applicants did not allow her to meet with her daughter and insisted that unless and until she brings an amount of Rs. 5 lacs and a gold chain of 3 Tolas, she should not come back otherwise, she should stay back in her parental home. The applicant No. 1 also assaulted her on that issue. A threat was also extended that in case if any effort is made in future to meet her daughter then she would be killed. Accordingly, an application was given to the Police Station and case was fixed for reconciliation on 4/9/2019 but the reconciliation failed. Challenging the FIR, it is submitted by counsel for the applicants that the applicants had issued a notice on 10/8/2017 and immediately thereafter she made a complaint on 13/8/2017 and reconciliation proceedings were undertaken. Copy of the reconciliation proceedings have been placed on record. It is submitted that in the reconciliation proceedings, it was alleged by respondent No. 2 that she is being harassed by the applicants but the applicant No. 1 refuted the same and also expressed that he can reside separately from applicants No. 2 and 3. On 27/8/2017, applicant No. 1 informed that they had resided for some time but now the respondent No. 2 has gone back to her parental home and on 10/9/2017, both the parties expressed that they are residing amicably and peacefully. It is submitted that the applicant No. 1 had taken a house on rent and had started residing separately with respondent No. 2, therefore, from year 2017, applicants No. 2 and 3 have separated themselves from applicant No. 1, therefore, there is no question of demand of dowry or committing cruelty. Per contra, the application is vehemently opposed by counsel for the State. It is submitted that where the allegations make out a cognizable offence, then the FIR can be lodged. In the present case there is a specific allegation that the applicants had treated the respondent No. 2 with cruelty. The extent of cruelty has gone to the extent of separating her daughter from respondent No. 2 and they had not allowed her to even meet her. In absence of any order from the Court with regard to custody of daughter, the conduct of the applicants in forcibly separating a minor daughter aged about 2-3 years from her mother, who is the natural guardian itself would amount to cruelty. Respondent No. 2 is being compelled to reside in her parental home, therefore, it is clear that all the applicants are guilty of committing cruelty and thus, no case is made out for quashment of FIR. Heard learned counsel for the parties. So far as the submission that the applicant No. 1 had taken a house on rent and had started residing separately after the reconciliation proceedings which took place in year 2017 is concerned, the applicants have not filed any document to show that any separate house on rent was taken. Thus, the verbal submissions made by counsel for the applicants that the applications No. 2 and 3 have started residing separately from the year 2017 is misconceived and cannot be accepted at this stage. Furthermore, in the FIR, it is specifically mentioned that on 29/9/2019 when she went to her matrimonial house in order to meet her daughter then not only she was abused in filthy language but she was beaten by applicant No. 1. Separating a mother from her 2-3 years old minor daughter without any order from the Court by itself would be a cruelty because mother being the natural guardian is entitled for the custody of her minor daughter. Be that whatever it may be. Compelling a married woman to live in her parental home on account of non-fulfillment of demand of dowry by itself is a cruelty. The Supreme Court in the case of Rupali Devi v. State of U. P. , reported in (2019) 5 SCC 384 has held as under: "Cruelty which is the crux of the offence under Section 498-A IPC is defined in Black's Law Dictionary to mean the intentional and malicious infliction of mental or physical suffering on a living creature, esp. a human; abusive treatment; outrage (abuse, inhuman treatment, indignity)". Cruelty can be both physical or mental cruelty. The impact on the mental health of the wife by overt acts on the part of the husband or his relatives; the mental stress and trauma of being driven away from the matrimonial home and her helplessness to go back to the same home for fear of being ill-treated are aspects that cannot be ignored while understanding the meaning of the expression "cruelty" appearing in Section 498-A of the Penal Code. The emotional distress or psychological effect on the wife, if not the physical injury, is bound to continue to traumatise the wife even after she leaves the matrimonial home and takes shelter at the parental home. Even if the acts of physical cruelty committed in the matrimonial house may have ceased and such acts do not occur at the parental home, there can be no doubt that the mental trauma and the psychological distress caused by the acts of the husband including verbal exchanges, if any, that had compelled the wife to leave the matrimonial home and take shelter with her parents would continue to persist at the parental home. Mental cruelty borne out of physical cruelty or abusive and humiliating verbal exchanges would continue in the parental home even though there may not be any overt act of physical cruelty at such place. This Court in the case of Amar Singh vs. Smt. Vimla decided on 22. 06. 2021 in Criminal Revision No. 2376/2020 (Gwalior Bench) has held that compelling a married woman to live in her parental home amounts to cruelty. The Supreme Court in the case of Taramani Parakh Vs. State of M. P. and Ors. has held as under: "The law relating to quashing is well settled. If the allegations are absurd or do not make out any case or if it can be held that there is abuse of process of law, the proceedings can be quashed but if there is a triable case the court does not go into reliability or otherwise of the version or the counter-version. In matrimonial cases, the courts have to be cautious when omnibus allegations are made particularly against relatives who are not generally concerned with the affairs of the couple. We may refer to the decisions of this Court dealing with the issue. " Furthermore, it is well established principle of law that at the stage of quashment of FIR or the proceedings under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. , this Court has to consider uncontroverted allegations and only if the uncontroverted allegations do not make out an offence then the proceedings can be quashed. This Court has already considered the allegations made in the FIR. Trial is pending and whenever the complainant appeared before the trial Court, applicants ensured that her evidence is not recorded. Under these circumstances, where the FIR makes out a cognizable offence, this Court is of considered opinion that no case is made out warranting interference. Application fails and is hereby dismissed.

[case 22]
By this common order, both the aforesaid criminal revisions are being decided. Both the criminal revisions arise out of order dated 23. 07. 2019 passed by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Bhind (M. P. ) in Case No. 138/2017 MJCR by which application for grant of maintenance under Section 125 of Cr. P. C. filed by Smt. Priyanka Rajawat has been rejected on the ground that she is residing separately without any reasonable reason whereas Virat Rajawat has been granted maintenance at the rate of 4, 000/- per month. Criminal Revision No. 5206 of 2019 has been filed by Rahul Singh @ Vijay Singh Rajawat who is husband of respondent No. 1-Smt. Priyanka Rajawat and father of respondent No. 2-Virat Rajawat against maintenance amount awarded to his son respondent No. 2-Virat Rajawat whereas Criminal Revision No. 4107 of 2019 has been filed by Smt. Priyanka Rajawat and Virat Rajawat against the rejection of claim of applicant No. 1-Smt. Priyanka Rajawat for maintenance under Section 125 of Cr. P. C. The facts of Criminal Revision No. 5206 of 2019 shall be referred to. The undisputed facts are that applicant- Rahul Singh @ Vijay Singh Rajawat and respondent No. 1-Smt. Priyanka Rajawat are the legally wedded husband and wife whereas respondent No. 2-Virat is the child born out of their wedlock. Respondents No. 1 and 2 filed an application under Section 125 of Cr. P. C. alleging that respondent No. 1 and applicant got married on 30. 04. 2015 in accordance with Hindu rites and rituals. It is the case of respondent No. 1 that applicant as well as his family members were not satisfied with the dowry brought by her. They were alleging that a four wheeler vehicle was decided to be given in dowry which was not done. Accordingly, it was alleged that applicant and his family members were harassing her physically and mentally. Even after respondent No. 1 got pregnant, still the cruelty did not come to an end. The entire expenses of delivery were borne by respondent No. 1 and her family members. Panchayats were convened and accordingly for sometime respondent no. 1 was kept properly but thereafter she was continuously harassed physically and mentally. On 23. 05. 2017 at about 06: 00 pm when respondent No. 1 was in her matrimonial house then her mother-in-law and father-in-law abused her filthily and after assaulting her by fists and blows turned her out of her matrimonial house along with her small child. It was alleged that respondent No. 1 does not have any independent source of livelihood whereas applicant is working as Panchayat Secretary earning a monthly salary of Rs. 15, 000/-. Apart from that he is having land and house and accordingly, it was alleged that applicant is having monthly income of Rs. 30, 000-35, 000/-. Applicant- Rahul filed his reply and denied the allegations. It was alleged that in fact it was respondent No. 1 who was creating all sorts of nuisance in the house. It was also stated that the delivery expenses were borne by applicant. It was further alleged that respondent No. 1 had voluntarily left the house. On 14. 01. 2017 and on 04. 06. 2017, he also went to the house of parents of respondent No. 1 to bring her back but she did not come back. Accordingly, it was alleged that he has filed an application under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act for restitution of conjugal rights. The Trial Court, after recording the statements of witnesses, rejected the application filed by respondent No. 1 whereas allowed the application filed respondent No. 2 and awarded Rs. 4, 000/- per month as maintenance. The reason for rejecting the claim of respondent No. 1 was that she was residing separately without any reasonable reason. Challenging the order passed by the Trial Court in granting monthly maintenance of Rs. 4, 000 to respondent No. 2, it was submitted by counsel for applicant that since respondent No. 1 is residing separately without any reasonable reason, therefore, respondent No. 2 is also not entitled for maintenance, whereas in Criminal Revision No. 4107 of 2019 it was contended by counsel for Smt. Priyanka Rajawat that Trial Court has committed material illegality by holding that she was residing separately without any reasonable reason. In reply, it was submitted by counsel for applicant-Rahul Singh Rajawat (respondent in Criminal Revision No. 4107 of 2019) that finding with regard to non-entitlement of Smt. Priyanka Rajawat to get the maintenance is based on sound principles of law and reasoning and therefore does not require any interference. Undisputedly, Virat Rajawat is minor boy born out of wedlock of Smt. Priyanka Rajawat and Rahul Singh Rajawat. He cannot be held responsible for any dispute which is going on between husband and wife. The father is under an obligation to maintain his child. Furthermore, it is the case of respondent No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat that monthly income of Rahul Singh Rajawat is 30, 000-35000/-. Accordingly, this Court is of the considered opinion that looking to the age of Virat Rajawat, the maintenance amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month awarded by the Trial Court cannot be said to be either on lower side or on higher side. Accordingly, the maintenance amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month awarded to Virat Rajawat is hereby affirmed. It is the case of applicant Rahul Singh Rajawat that it was respondent No. 1 Smt. Priyanka Rajawat who voluntarily left her matrimonial house and her behaviour towards her in-laws was also not proper. It was further submitted that an FIR was also lodged under Section 498A of IPC because father of respondent No. 1 Smt. Priyanka Rajawat is working as a Head Constable. Per contra, it is submitted by counsel for respondent No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat that merely because of an application under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act was filed would not mean that respondent No. 1 Smt. Priyanka Rajawat left her matrimonial house on her own volition. However, it is further submitted that even the application under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act was withdrawn by her husband Rahul Singh Rajawat. Considered the submissions made by counsel for the parties. The moot question for consideration is as to whether merely filing an application under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act would make the wife ineligible for grant of maintenance or not? If wife is being treated with cruelty then she cannot be compelled to live in her matrimonial house. Under these circumstances, mere filing of an application under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage Act ipso facto would not make the wife disentitled for grant of maintenance. Supreme Court in the case of Rina Kumari @ Rina Devi @ Reena Vs Dinesh Kumar Mahto @ Dinesh Kumar Mahato and another, Special Leave Petition (Crl. ) No. 5896 of 2024 decided on 10. 01. 2025, has held that even if decree under Section 9 of Hindu Marriage has been passed, still the wife can claim maintenance amount. Where the parties are at loggerheads and an FIR under Section 498A of IPC has also been lodged, under these circumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion that rejection of claim of respondent No. 1 (Smt. Priyanka Rajawat) for grant of maintenance appears to be contrary to law. The reasoning assigned by the Trial Court for holding that respondent No. 1-Smt. Priyanka Rajawat was living separately without any reasonable reason cannot be affirmed. Under these circumstances, order dated 23. 07. 2019 with regard to rejection of claim of respondent No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat for grant of maintenance cannot be upheld and it is accordingly set aside. Now, the next question for consideration is that what should be the maintenance amount for respondent No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat? According to respondent No. 1-Smt. Priyanka Rajawat, monthly income of applicant- Rahul Singh Rajawat is Rs. 30, 000-35000/-. Although it is the contention of applicant-Rahul Singh Rajawat that father of respondent No. 1 is working as Head Constable in police department and therefore, she is not ready to adjust in the family of applicant but during the course of arguments it was also admitted by applicant that his father is also working in the police department. Under these circumstances, this Court is of considered opinion that monthly maintenance amount of Rs. 6, 000/- to respondent No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat would be sufficient. Accordingly, it is held that respondent No. 1-Priyanka Rajawat is entitled for monthly maintenance at the rate of Rs. 6, 000/-. In the light of judgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of Rajnesh Vs. Neha reported in (2021) 2 SCC 324, the aforesaid amount shall be payable from the date of application. With aforesaid observations, Criminal Revision No. 5206 of 2019 is hereby dismissed whereas Criminal Revision No. 4107 of 2019 is allowed to the extent of applicant No. 1- Smt. Priyanka Rajawat. No order as to costs.

Prior notice of this bail application was served in the office of Government Advocate and as per Chapter XVIII, Rule 18 of the Allahabad High Court Rules and as per direction dated 20. 11. 2020 of this Court in Criminal Misc. Anticipatory Bail Application U/S 438 Cr. P. C. No. 8072 of 2020, Govind Mishra @ Chhotu Versus State of U. P. , hence, this anticipatory bail application is being heard. Grant of further time to the learned A. G. A as per Section 438 (3) Cr. P. C. (U. P. Amendment) is not required.
There is allegation of enticement of minor girl against the applicant. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that at the relevant time the girl was not minor. She has married with the applicant. The applicant has been falsely implicated in this case. The victim has not supported the prosecution case in her statement under section 164 Cr. P. C. . The present application is supported by the affidavit of the girl herself. A child has been born out of their wedlock. Therefore, it would not be in the interest of justice not to grant protection to the applicant since there is no one to look after his family. She is living with the applicant. The charge sheet has already been submitted against the applicant. The applicant will cooperate with the trial. He has no criminal history to his credit. The applicant has a definite apprehension that he may be arrested by the police any time.
Learned A. G. A. has opposed the prayer for anticipatory bail of the applicant. He has submitted that in view of the seriousness of the allegations made against the applicant, he is not entitled to grant of anticipatory bail. The apprehension of the applicant is not founded on any material on record. Only on the basis of imaginary fear, anticipatory bail cannot be granted.
After considering the rival submissions, this Court finds that there is a case registered against the applicant. It cannot be definitely said when the police may apprehend him. After the lodging of F. I. R, the arrest can be made by the police at will. There is no definite period fixed for the police to arrest an accused against whom an F. I. R has been lodged. The courts have repeatedly held that arrest should be the last option for the police and it should be restricted to those exceptional cases where arresting the accused is imperative or his custodial interrogation is required. Irrational and indiscriminate arrests are gross violation of human rights. In the case of Joginder Kumar v. State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1994 SC 1349, the Apex Court has referred to the third report of National Police Commission wherein it is mentioned that arrests by the police in India is one of the chief sources of corruption in the police. The report suggested that, by and large, nearly 60 percent of the arrests were either unnecessary or unjustified and that such unjustified police action accounted for 43. 2 percent of expenditure of the jails. Personal liberty is a very precious fundamental right and it should be curtailed only when it becomes imperative. According to the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the arrest of an accused should be made.
Hence without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case and considering the nature of accusations and antecedents of applicant and also the second surge in the cases of novel coronavirus and possibility of further surge of the pandemic, he is directed to be enlarged on anticipatory bail as per the Constitution Bench judgment of the Apex Court in the case of Sushila Aggarwal vs. State (NCT of Delhi)- 2020 SCC Online SC 98. The future contingencies regarding anticipatory bail being granted to applicant shall also be taken care of as per the aforesaid judgment of the Apex Court.
In the event of arrest, the applicant shall be released on anticipatory bail. Let the applicant involved in the aforesaid crime be released on anticipatory bail on furnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court concerned with the following conditions: -
1. The applicant shall, at the time of execution of the bond, furnish his address and mobile number and shall not change the residence till the conclusion of investigation/ trial without informing the Investigating Officer of the police/ the Court concerned of change of address and the reasons for the same before changing the same.
2. The applicant shall not leave the country during the pendency of trial/investigation by police without prior permission from the concerned trial Court.
3. The applicant shall not obstruct or hamper the police investigation and not play mischief with the evidence collected or yet to be collected by the Investigating Officer of the police;
4. The applicant shall surrender his passport, if any, to the concerned Court/Investigating Officer forthwith. His passport will remain in custody of the concerned Court/ Investigating Officer till the investigation is completed. In case he has no passport, he will file his affidavit before the Court/ Investigating Officer concerned in this regard.
5. That the applicant shall not, directly or indirectly, make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer;

THIS APPEAL, COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY, JUDGMENT WAS DELIVERED THEREIN AS UNDER: CORAM: THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H. T. NARENDRA PRASAD AND THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VENKATESH NAIK T ORAL JUDGMENT (PER: THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VENKATESH NAIK T) This appeal is filed by the husband challenging the judgment and decree dated 23. 03. 2020 passed in M. C. No. 44/2015 by the learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Karwar, allowing the petition filed by the wife under Section 13(1)(ia) and (ib) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act', for short) dissolving the marriage solemnized between the appellant and the respondent on 23. 06. 2007. The appellant/husband was the respondent and the respondent/wife was the petitioner in M. C. No. 44/2015 before the Family Court. For the sake of convenience, the parties are referred to as per their rank before the Family Court henceforth. Brief facts of the case are that, the marriage of the petitioner with the respondent was solemnized on 23. 06. 2007 at Jain Mandir, LBS Road, Bhandup West Mumbai as per Hindu rites, rituals and custom prevailed in their community. The petitioner is a B. Com graduate and the respondent is a B. E. Mechanical Engineer and working as Scientific Research Assistant for Baba Atomic Research Centre at Mumbai. After marriage, the petitioner was taken to flat of the respondent at No. A/22, Sarvamangal CHS, 6th floor, Bhandu. Since the brothers and their wives of the respondent were employed, the petitioner was put under pressure to secure a job. The respondent and his mother hit the petitioner, abused and adversely compared her with the daughter-in-law who was working as steno in the Ministry. The petitioner secured job at S. K. Group company on monthly salary of Rs. 5, 000/-. After sometime she became pregnant and she had to quit the job. The respondent and his mother were against the pregnancy and pressurized the petitioner to terminate the pregnancy to which she did not agree. Therefore, the petitioner hit the petitioner with broom, due to which she started bleeding. The respondent did not take the petitioner for medical treatment and she herself got admitted to the hospital and the respondent and his family members did not assist the petitioner in any way. The mother of the petitioner requested the respondent to be kind with the petitioner, but the respondent continued to abuse and ill treat the petitioner. It is contended that the respondent is actively participating with black magic with the help of Babas and Maulvis. The respondent took the petitioner to them and also to psychiatrist and enquired the doctors about aborting the child. Therefore, the petitioner came to her parental house at Karwar at seven months of pregnancy and gave birth to a baby boy and neither the respondent nor his family members attended the cradle ceremony on 05. 06. 2008. After three months, the petitioner returned to house of the respondent. It is contended that the child was admitted to an expensive school by the respondent and he took money from the petitioner for the fees and due to the extravagant behaviour of the respondent, the petitioner had to take up employment with Manha finance and later at Forties Hospital Pvt. Ltd. On 23. 08. 2015, the respondent beat the petitioner and driven out her from the house. Police complaint was also lodged in that regard and she has taken shelter at Sri. Mukti Sangathana and after intervention of police and Sangathana, she went to live with the respondent. After a couple of days, he thrashed her again with slipper in front of the maid servant who rescued her and unable to bear the same, she returned to her parental home at Karwar. Hence, she filed a petition seeking a decree for dissolution of her marriage with the respondent. After institution of the petition before the Family Court, the respondent/husband appeared through counsel and filed a detailed objection admitting their marriage, qualification and the child born out of their wedlock but, however, denied the allegation of use of abusive words, assault and harassment both physically and mentally. The petitioner, in order to prove her case, got examined herself as PW-1 and got marked three document as Exs. P1 to P-3. On behalf of the respondent, the respondent except examining himself as RW. 1, did not produce any documents. The Family Court after considering the oral and documentary evidence on record, allowed the petition in part by awarding decree of divorce and granting permanent alimony of Rs. 10, 00, 000/- to the petitioner. Being aggrieved by the impugned order, the respondent/husband has filed this appeal. Learned counsel for appellant/husband vehemently contended that, the petitioner/wife is a B. Com graduate. The petitioner, prior to the marriage was working and earning good amount of salary and currently she is working at Forties Hospital, Goa as an accountant. The respondent/husband is a Mechanical Engineer and is working as a Scientific Research Assistant at Bhaba Atomic Research Centre at Mumbai. Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant has no grievance with respect to the order of decree of divorce granted by the Family Court, but is aggrieved by the direction of the Family Court to pay permanent alimony of Rs. 10, 00, 000/- to the respondent. He contended that since the respondent is working at Forties Hospital, Goa as an accountant, grant of permanent alimony to the petitioner/wife does not arise. Hence, the learned counsel prays to reduce the grant of permanent alimony to the petitioner/wife. Heard the learned counsel for the appellant/husband. Though the respondent/wife is served, she remained absent. We have perused the entire material available on record. Since, as contended by the learned counsel for the appellant that he has no grievance with regard to the decree of divorce granted by the Family Court, we restrain ourselves from considering the said aspect. So far as the grievance of the appellant with respect to grant of permanent alimony is concerned, from the perusal of the oral evidence of PW. 1, RW. 1 and Exs. P-1 to 3, it clearly establish that the respondent is working and from the evidence it reveals that the petitioner/wife is working at Forties Hospital, Goa, as an accountant. Further the petitioner/wife and the respondent/husband have a son who is studying in PUC. Therefore, it is the duty of the respondent, who being the father and husband, has to look after his son as well as his wife/petitioner. Considering the status of the parties, including the education of their son, their avocation, cost of living in the present society and with regard to the facts and circumstances of the present case, it is just and necessary to reduce the permanent alimony of Rs. 10, 00, 000/- awarded by the Family Court to Rs. 5, 00, 000/- which would meet the ends of justice. Hence, we proceed to pass the following: ORDER i) The appeal is allowed in part. The judgment and decree dated 23. 03. 2020 passed in M. C. No. 44/2015 by the learned Principal Senior Civil Judge, Karwar, is hereby confirmed. However, the permanent alimony granted by the family Court is reduced to Rs. 5, 00, 000/- from Rs. 10, 00, 000/-. ii) The appellant/husband is directed to pay permanent alimony of Rs. 5, 00, 000/- to the respondent within four months from today.

P. & Anr. on 20 July, 2021 Author: Alok Mathur Bench: Alok Mathur HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH? Court No. - 15 Case: - BAIL No. - 6901 of 2020 Applicant: - Avinash Tripathi Opposite Party: - State Of U. P. & Anr. Counsel for Applicant: - Prashant Singh Gaur, Anil Kumar Dwivedi, Sudhanshu Mishra, Umesh Kumar Yadav Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Alok Mathur, J. 1. Heard Sri Umesh Kumar Yadav, learned counsel for applicant as well as learned Additional Government Advocate. 2. Office has reported by means of report dated 01. 03. 2021 that respondent No. 2 has been served but no one has put in appearance on her behalf, the Court has proceeded to hear the bail application. 2. This application has been filed by the applicant who is an accused in connection with Case Crime No. 0108/2018, under Sections 376(D), 506 I. P. C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station - Rajesultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar. 3. It has been submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the first information report was lodged by the prosecutrix herself who stated that she is 17 years of age and the occurrence relates to six months prior in time. One Prashant Mishra has been accused of dragging her into the field and sexually assaulted the prosecutrix. At the time of lodging of the first information report, it was stated that the prosecutrix was pregnant for six months and that the said accused therein, namely, Prashant Mishra has refused to marry her and consequently the first information report was lodged. The statement under Section 161 of Cr. P. C. was recorded after six months on 18. 06. 2018 where she has reiterated the contents of the first information report and named Prashant Kumar as to the person who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix. The statement under Section 164 Cr. P. C. was recorded on 18. 07. 2018, it is stated that the applicant has been named as one of the person who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix and consequently he was shown as an accused and chargesheet has been filed in the court of competent jurisdiction. 4. It has been submitted by learned counsel for applicant that the entire story as narrated by the prosecutrix is unbelievable and not worthy of any credence. He submits that the first information report was lodged by the prosecutrix herself and that too after six months of the incident and there is no explanation that as to why the applicant was not named as an accused or any other perosn who has sexually assaulted the prosecutrix in the F. I. R. itself. 5. It has further been submitted that the statement under Section 161 Cr. P. C. was recorded after six months where again the name of the applicant has not been shown as an accused. He submits that it is in the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. where the name of the applicant has come up and there is no reason that as to why the applicant was named in the statement recorded under Section 161 Cr. P. C. 6. It has further been submitted that D. N. A. test of the child was conducted for comparing to the same with the D. N. A. of the prosecutrix and to the said Prashant Mishra and the D. N. A. testing was confirmed that the father of the child is Prashant Mishra and not the applicant. 7. It has lastly been submitted that the applicant is in jail since 26. 06. 2020. 8. Learned A. G. A. opposed the prayer for bail and submits that the applicant has clearly named the applicant in the Statement recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. , therefore the applicant is not entitled for bail looking into the of his complicity in the case. 9. I have heard learned counsel for parties and perused the record. It is clear that there is no reason forth coming as to why the prosecutrix has not named the applicant either in the first information report or in the statement recorded after six months under Section 164 Cr. P. C. Coupled with the fact that the D. N. A. report has not confirmed the parentage of the child to that of the applicant herein and also considering the nature of allegations, arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties as well as the fact that applicant has in jail since 26. 06. 2020 where he has spent nearly one year in judicial custory, without expressing any opinion on the merit of the case, I find it to be a fit case for granting bail. 10. Let the applicant/Avinash Tripathi involved in Case Crime No. 0108/2018, under Sections 376(D), 506 I. P. C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station - Rajesultanpur, Ambedkar Nagar be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice: - (i) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court. In case of default of this condition, it shall be open for the trial court to treat it as abuse of liberty of bail and pass orders in accordance with law. (ii) The applicant shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through his counsel. In case of his absence, without sufficient cause, the trial court may proceed against him under Section 229-A of the Indian Penal Code. (iii) In case, the applicant misuses the liberty of bail during trial and in order to secure his presence, proclamation under Section 82 Cr. P. C. is issued and the applicant fails to appear before the court on the date fixed in such proclamation, then, the trial court shall initiate proceedings against him, in accordance with law, under Section 174-A of the Indian Penal Code. (iv) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the trial court on the dates fixed for (i) opening of the case, (ii) framing of charge and (iii) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr. P. C. If in the opinion of the trial court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the trial court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law. 11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, the Court below shall be at liberty to cancel the bail and proceed against the applicant in accordance with law. 12.

[case 29]
This revision under Section 102 of the Juvenile Justice ( Care and Protection of Children), Act, 2015 has been preferred by the revisionist Satyam Yadav, (Minor) through his father Jai Prakash Yadav against the judgment and order dated 21. 10. 2021 passed by learned Special Judge (POCSO) Act, Pratapgarh in criminal appeal no. 40 of 2021 and impugned order dated 22. 6. 2021 passed by the learned Juvenile Justice Board, Pratapgarh in case crime no. 247 of 2021 under Sections 302, 307, 34 I. P. C. and under Section 3 (2) (v), 3 (2) (Va) of the Scheduled Castes And the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, Police Station- Kotwali City, district- Pratapgarh. He heard learned counsel for the revisionist and learned A. G. A for State of U. P. Learned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that the revisionist is juvenile and has falsely been implicated in the present case. The revisionist is not named in the F. I. R. The name of the revisionist has been disclosed after 62 days of the alleged incident only on the basis of the statement of the injured- Jangbahadur. He further submitted that no body has seen the occurrence. The main role has been assigned to Luvkush. Thus, applicant has been named in the present case only on the basis of the suspicion but there is no cogent and credible evidence against him. The false recovery of danda has also been shown from the possession of the revisionist. Similarly co-accused- Jai Prakash Yadav has been granted bail by this Court in Criminal Appeal no. 1004 of 2021 on 19. 8. 2021. No specific role has been assigned against him. No incriminating fact has been mentioned in the report submitted by the District Probation Officer. If he is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail. He is languishing in remand home since 19. 3. 2021. The impugned orders are against the provision of law which are liable to be set aside. Learned A. G. A has vehemently opposed the prayer made by the learned counsel for the revisionist and submitted that if the revisionist is released on bail, he will join in the company of habitual criminal, hence he is not entitled for bail. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 (Act) has been enacted with object to reform and protect the future career of children below the age of 18 years. The main purpose of this Act is to keep the juvenile out of company and society of habitual criminals and to keep them in place of safety. The parameter and guidelines for assessment of plea of bail of a juvenile has been provided in Section 12 of the Act which is as under: - "When any person accused of a bailable or non-bailable offence, and apparently a juvenile, is arrested or detained or appears or is brought before a Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974) or in any other law for the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety 1[or placed under the supervision of a Probation Officer or under the care of any fit institution of fit person] but he shall not be so released if there appear reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal or expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger or that his release would defeat the ends of justice. When such person having been arrested is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by the officer incharge of the police station, such officer shall cause him to be kept only in an observation home in the prescribed manner until he can be brought before a Board. When such person is not released on bail under sub-section (1) by the Board it shall, instead of committing him to prison, make an order sending him to an observation home or a place of safety for such period during the pendency of the inquiry regarding him as may be specified in the order. " Thus it is clear that the provision for release to a juvenile has overriding effect to any provision contained in Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 or in any other law for the time being in force. According to this provision, a duty has been cost to grant bail to a juvenile unless there is a reasonable ground for plea that the release is likely to bring the juvenile into association with any known criminal or exposed the said juvenile to moral, physical or psychological danger or that his release would defeat the end of justice. Plea of bail raised by juvenile cannot be rejected in a mechanical manner. While considering the parameter provided in Section 12 of the Act, nature of offence, role played by the juvenile in committing the offence, his family background, his association with known or unknown criminals or bad elements of society, number of person named in the occurrence and future carrier of juvenile should also be taken into consideration by Juvenile Justice Board or court concerned in addition to the other factors. It has been held by the supreme court in Dr. Subramaniam Swamy vs Raju, 2014 (86) ACC 637 that a juvenile has to be released on bail unless the court has a reasonable ground to believe that his release will bring him into association of some known criminal, or will expose him to moral, physical or psychological danger or his release would defeat the ends of justice. Section 15 of the Amending Act only provides for transfer of a juvenile to the Children Court for trial as an adult. Where the child has attained the age of 16 years and has been alleged to have committed heinous offence, the JJ Board is required to conduct a preliminary inquiry with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit offence, ability to understand the consequence of the offence and the circumstances in which the offence was committed considering their physical, psychological and mental status in commission of crime. Section 18(3) of the Act provides that after making the assessment under section 15, JJ Board comes to a conclusion that there is a need for trial of the child as an adult, the Board may pass an order for the transfer of the trial of the case to the Children Court. In this case the revisionist was aged about 16 years at the time of occurrence. Admittedly the revisionist was juvenile at the time of occurrence. No material is available on record whereby it can be presumed that the revisionist was in association of any criminal or bad elements. From perusal of impugned judgement and order passed by the appellate Court as well as passed by the Board, it transpires that both the trial court have passed the impugned judgement and orders in cursory manner without placing due reliance on the report submitted by the District Probation Officer as well as facts and circumstances of this case. The impugned judgment and orders are liable to be set aside. Consequently, the revision succeeds and is allowed. Both the impugned judgment and order 21. 10. 2021 and 22. 6. 2021 are hereby set aside. Let the revisionist Satyam Yadav through his natural guardian/father Jai Prakash Yadav be released on bail in the aforesaid criminal case and be given into custody of aforesaid natural guardian on furnishing a personal bond with two solvent sureties of relatives of the aforesaid natural guardian each in like amount to the satisfaction of Juvenile Justice Board concerned on the following conditions. (i)That, Jai Prakash Yadav natural guardian of the revisionist will furnish an undertaking that upon release on bail, the juvenile will not be permitted to go into contact or association with any known or unknown criminal or exposed to any moral or physical danger and will not indulge in any criminal activity and aforesaid natural guardian will make best effort for improvement of juvenile's carrier. (ii)That the revisionist and his aforesaid natural guardian shall remain present before the trial court on each date fixed, either personally or through counsel. Order Date: - 24. 1. 2023

SURESHKUMAR RESPONDENT(S)/COMPLAINANT: STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SMT. V. SREEJA THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 19-06-2018, THE COURT ON 25/6/2018 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER The accused in Crime No. 548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act 2012 and under section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015, are the petitioners herein. 2. Admitted facts are as follows; The first petitioner had married the defacto complainant on 27/4/2009. Thereafter, they resided together for some time. The second petitioner is his father and the third petitioner is his mother. A girl child was born, who is aged 7 years now. Matrimonial dispute arose between the parties. It is stated that, on 5/9/2017, the wife left the matrimonial home. The child was in the custody of the petitioners till 15/9/2017, on which day the child was entrusted with the parents of the defacto complainant. The present complaint was laid by the wife alleging that the first petitioner had sexually abused the seven year old girl on few days between 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017 at the matrimonial home and other places. Apprehending arrest, the petitioners herein have approached the court. 3. The specific contention of the petitioners herein is that, the defacto complainant was a quarrelsome person and matrimonial relationship became incompatible. It was alleged that, the defacto complainant had developed a close intimacy with one doctor who was younger to her. She was found making secret audio and video calls to him over the mobile phone. When the relationship went beyond a limit, the husband intervened and she was warned. It was later understood that she continued to maintain even physical relationship with him. On being confronted with materials, she is stated to have abandoned the child and left the matrimonial home on 5/9/2017. Thereafter, the first petitioner herein entrusted the child to the defacto complainant and her parents, considering the education of the child. The first petitioner herein initiated matrimonial proceedings, including an application for custody of the child. The present complaint was filed belatedly raising absolutely false allegations with the intention of denying him the custody of the child. It was vehemently contended that, the first petitioner herein has not committed any sexual abuse on the minor girl and it was purposefully and belatedly set up. 4. Annexure A1 is a copy of the petition in O. P. (HMA) No. 649/2017 dated 27/10/2017 filed by the first petitioner herein before the Family Court, Malappuram. He claimed divorce on the ground of adultery of the defacto complainant with the doctor, who was arrayed as the second respondent in that O. P. It was alleged therein that, she was having continuous physical relationship with that doctor and was caught with evidence. Annexure A2 is a copy of O. P. ( G & W) No. 356/2018 filed by the first petitioner herein on 24/5/2018 before the Family Court, Malappuram claiming custody of the child. Thereafter, Crime was got registered by the wife at Bangalore as Crime No. 703/2017 on 11/12/2017 against the petitioners herein alleging matrimonial cruelty. The first petitioner sought bail which was granted by Annexure A3 order. It is seen that, she alleged that the petitioners herein committed acts of matrimonial cruelty and demanded dowry and thereby committed offences punishable under section 498A IPC and the provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The petitioner was granted anticipatory bail. Annexure A5 is a complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the State Commission for Protection of Child Child Rights of Kerala and Karnataka, with copies to the various authorities. It was alleged that, the father-in-law of the defacto complainant had made sexual advances towards her. She alleged that, in-laws had administered various medicines on her body. It was also alleged that, the child was physically assaulted by the petitioners during the period from 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017. There is an allegation that, the grandfather used to beat her on her groin and grand mother had beaten the child with a chapathy rolling pin. Annexure A6 is the complaint No. 20/2018 filed on 24/1/2018 by the defacto complainant under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. 5. The above documents clearly show that, at no point of time earlier, the defacto complainant had a case that the child was sexually abused by the father. Even though physical assault is alleged against the petitioners, there was absolutely no reference anywhere that the child was subjected to sexual abuse by the father. 6. It seems that, for the first time such a complaint is seen raised in the present crime(Crime No. 548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station). Crime was thereupon registered for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015. The crux of the allegation in the FIS is that, during the period when the child was in the custody of the petitioners, the father of the child used to give her a bath. He used to undress her, remove his dress and give her bath. It was stated that in the course of bathing her, the first petitioner used to tickle her. The child has stated that, she did not like boys giving her bath. Pursuant to it, section 164 Cr. P. C. statement of the victim was also recorded, which is substantially in tune with FI statement. 7. It is pertinent to note that the only allegation raised against the first petitioner is as above. Even if the entire statement made by the child is taken at its face value, crucial question that arises is whether the father had any sexual intent while giving the daughter a bath. This has to be appreciated in the background that the allegation comes only at a highly belated stage, when the father himself had sought custody of the child. No explanation is forthcoming for the delay in giving complaint. Hence, the question to be investigated by the police is only whether the first petitioner herein with sexual intention had committed any act. For that, custodial interrogation does not appear to be warranted. It is also clear that, in such a very strained matrimonial relationship a belated allegation of this nature has to be considered carefully and it may not be safe to order custodial interrogation. 8. Having regard to the above, I am inclined to grant benefit of anticipatory bail to the petitioners herein subject to the following conditions: i). Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer within ten days from today and shall undergo interrogation. Thereafter, if they are proposed to be arrested, they shall be released on bail on each of the petitioner executing a bond for a sum of Rs. 50, 000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each. ii). They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for and co-operate with the investigation. Anticipatory Bail Application is allowed.

SURESHKUMAR RESPONDENT(S)/COMPLAINANT: STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SMT. V. SREEJA THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING BEEN FINALLY HEARD ON 19-06-2018, THE COURT ON 25/6/2018 PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER The accused in Crime No. 548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act 2012 and under section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015, are the petitioners herein. Admitted facts are as follows; The first petitioner had married the defacto complainant on 27/4/2009. Thereafter, they resided together for some time. The second petitioner is his father and the third petitioner is his mother. A girl child was born, who is aged 7 years now. Matrimonial dispute arose between the parties. It is stated that, on 5/9/2017, the wife left the matrimonial home. The child was in the custody of the petitioners till 15/9/2017, on which day the child was entrusted with the parents of the defacto complainant. The present complaint was laid by the wife alleging that the first petitioner had sexually abused the seven year old girl on few days between 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017 at the matrimonial home and other places. Apprehending arrest, the petitioners herein have approached this court. The specific contention of the petitioners herein is that, the defacto complainant was a quarrelsome person and matrimonial relationship became incompatible. It was alleged that, the defacto complainant had developed a close intimacy with one doctor who was younger to her. She was found making secret audio and video calls to him over the mobile phone. When the relationship went beyond a limit, the husband intervened and she was warned. It was later understood that she continued to maintain even physical relationship with him. On being confronted with materials, she is stated to have abandoned the child and left the matrimonial home on 5/9/2017. Thereafter, the first petitioner herein entrusted the child to the defacto complainant and her parents, considering the education of the child. The first petitioner herein initiated matrimonial proceedings, including an application for custody of the child. The present complaint was filed belatedly raising absolutely false allegations with the intention of denying him the custody of the child. It was vehemently contended that, the first petitioner herein has not committed any sexual abuse on the minor girl and it was purposefully and belatedly set up. Annexure A1 is a copy of the petition in O. P. (HMA) No. 649/2017 dated 27/10/2017 filed by the first petitioner herein before the Family Court, Malappuram. He claimed divorce on the ground of adultery of the defacto complainant with the doctor, who was arrayed as the second respondent in that O. P. It was alleged therein that, she was having continuous physical relationship with that doctor and was caught with evidence. Annexure A2 is a copy of O. P. ( G & W) No. 356/2018 filed by the first petitioner herein on 24/5/2018 before the Family Court, Malappuram claiming custody of the child. Thereafter, Crime was got registered by the wife at Bangalore as Crime No. 703/2017 on 11/12/2017 against the petitioners herein alleging matrimonial cruelty. The first petitioner sought bail which was granted by Annexure A3 order. It is seen that, she alleged that the petitioners herein committed acts of matrimonial cruelty and demanded dowry and thereby committed offences punishable under section 498A IPC and the provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The petitioner was granted anticipatory bail. Annexure A5 is a complaint filed by the defacto complainant before the State Commission for Protection of Child Child Rights of Kerala and Karnataka, with copies to the various authorities. It was alleged that, the father-in-law of the defacto complainant had made sexual advances towards her. She alleged that, in-laws had administered various medicines on her body. It was also alleged that, the child was physically assaulted by the petitioners during the period from 5/9/2017 to 15/9/2017. There is an allegation that, the grandfather used to beat her on her groin and grandmother had beaten the child with a chapathy rolling pin. Annexure A6 is the complaint No. 20/2018 filed on 24/1/2018 by the defacto complainant under the provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act. The above documents clearly show that, at no point of time earlier, the defacto complainant had a case that the child was sexually abused by the father. Even though physical assault is alleged against the petitioners, there was absolutely no reference anywhere that the child was subjected to sexual abuse by the father. It seems that, for the first time such a complaint is seen raised in the present crime(Crime No. 548/2018 of Ottappalam Police station). Crime was thereupon registered for offences punishable under sections 7 & 8 of POCSO Act and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2015. The crux of the allegation in the FIS is that, during the period when the child was in the custody of the petitioners, the father of the child used to give her a bath. He used to undress her, remove his dress and give her bath. It was stated that in the course of bathing her, the first petitioner used to tickle her. The child has stated that, she did not like boys giving her bath. Pursuant to it, section 164 Cr. P. C. statement of the victim was also recorded, which is substantially in tune with FI statement. It is pertinent to note that the only allegation raised against the first petitioner is as above. Even if the entire statement made by the child is taken at its face value, crucial question that arises is whether the father had any sexual intent while giving the daughter a bath. This has to be appreciated in the background that the allegation comes only at a highly belated stage, when the father himself had sought custody of the child. No explanation is forthcoming for the delay in giving complaint. Hence, the question to be investigated by the police is only whether the first petitioner herein with sexual intention had committed any act. For that, custodial interrogation does not appear to be warranted. It is also clear that, in such a very strained matrimonial relationship a belated allegation of this nature has to be considered carefully and it may not be safe to order custodial interrogation. Having regard to the above, I am inclined to grant benefit of anticipatory bail to the petitioners herein subject to the following conditions: i). Petitioners shall appear before the investigating officer within ten days from today and shall undergo interrogation. Thereafter, if they are proposed to be arrested, they shall be released on bail on each of the petitioner executing a bond for a sum of Rs. 50, 000/-(Rupees fifty thousand only) with two sureties for the like sum each. ii). They shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when called for and co-operate with the investigation. Anticipatory Bail Application is allowed.

Delhi District Court State vs. Dilip S/O Sh. Kamal Kishore Yadav on 24 September, 2015 IN THE COURT OF SH. SIDHARTH SHARMA ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE-01 & SPECIAL JUDGE (NDPS) SHAHDARA DISTRICT, KARKARDOOMA COURTS, DELHI FIR No. : 17/2013 Under Sections: 509 IPC and 12 POCSO Act Police Station: Anand Vihar Sessions Case No. : 107/2013 Unique ID No. : 02402R0305352013 In the matter of: STATE Vs. DILIP S/o Sh. Kamal Kishore Yadav R/o D-540, LN 30 D-Block, Harsh Vihar, Delhi. .. .. .. .Accused Date of institution: 18. 09. 2013 Date of reserving judgment: 23. 09. 2015 Date of pronouncement: 24. 09. 2015 JUDGMENT 1. Briefly stated, the facts of the prosecution case are that on 11. 01. 2013, the minor child (female), aged 16 years (hereinafter referred as minor victim/prosecutrix), came at PS Anand Vihar and made a complaint against the accused Dilip for outraging her modesty by making gesture and using abusive language to her. SI Gunjan Singh present at the PS recorded statement of the prosecutrix wherein prosecutrix stated that she had studied upto 5th class and her parents run a stall of ironing the clothes in front of B-124, Anand Vihar, Delhi. She further states that one Dilip s/o Sh. Kamal Kishore Yadav, r/o D-540, LN 30 D-Block, Harsh Vihar, Delhi, aged 27 years who is a driver at B-70, Anand Vihar is known to her for last two years. He used to watch her for last few days and used to make gestures by waiving his hands and by making comments and used to ask her to have friendship with him. The complainant/prosecutrix alleged that on 10. 01. 2013, at 07. 00 p. m. , accused made a call to her and at that time her parents saw her while talking to him over phone and in anger, they gave beatings to her. She alleged that said Dilip had outraged her modesty by making gestures and making comments and prayed for legal action against the accused. 2. On the aforesaid complaint of prosecutrix, offences u/s 509 IPC and Section 12 POCSO Act were made out against the accused and accordingly IO SI Gunjan Singh got lodged the present case FIR and conducted the investigation. During investigation, IO arrested the accused; produced the prosecutrix before ld. MM who recorded her statement u/s 164 Cr. PC wherein she supported her statement made to the police; recorded statement of witnesses and after completion of investigation, filed the charge-sheet. 3. Vide order dated 09. 12. 2013, my ld. Predecessor framed the charge for offence u/s 509 IPC and 12 POCSO Act against the accused to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 4. The prosecution in support of its case examined five witnesses: (a) PW1 Smt. Laxmi is the mother of the prosecutrix. (b) PW2 is the prosecutrix who turned totally hostile to the case of prosecution. (c) PW3 is Smt. Geeta, Primary Teacher from Nigam Pratibha Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar, who proved the date of birth of prosecutrix as 15. 012. 1996 as per school record. (d) PW4 HC Prakash Veer is the Duty Officer. He proved the present case FIR. (e) PW5 is HC Narender Kumar who proved DD No. 21-A regarding information received from PCR about the incident of present case. 5. It was seen that the prosecution cited total 10 witnesses out of which 5 witnesses were examined in this case and PW1 and PW2 who are the only material witnesses in this case, did not support the case of prosecution and were declared hostile and were cross-examined by ld. Addl. PP for State. In these circumstances, no useful purpose would have been served in continuing the trial as the prosecution could not have succeeded in securing conviction of the accused even after examining the remaining witnesses who are formal in nature. Hence, the prosecution evidence was closed. 6. Statement of accused u/s 313 Cr. PC was recorded wherein he stated that he was innocent and was falsely implicated in this case by the police. He stated that prosecutrix was his friend and while she was talking to him over phone, her mother gave her merciless beatings and that is why he made a call at 100 and thereafter, as a counter-blast present false case was lodged against him. 7. I have heard submissions from Sh. Anil Kumar, learned Additional Public Prosecutor for State and from Sh. V. S. Chauhan Advocate for accused. I have also gone through the record. 8. For proving the offence u/s 509 IPC, the essential ingredient of mens-rea on the part of the accused is that there should be a clear intention to outrage the modesty of a woman and thereafter word or gesture had been made by the accused which intrudes the privacy of such woman. Similarly, for proving the offence u/s 12 POCSO Act, it is seen that sexual harassment upon the child by the accused should be with 'sexual intent' i. e. mens-rea of sexual intent before making any sound or gesture is a pre-requisite. 9. In order to appreciate if the ingredient of mense-rea have been satisfied, the evidence of material witnesses is required to be appreciated. The fate of this case depends upon the testimony of both the material witnesses examined in this case i. e. PW2 prosecutrix and PW1 Smt. Laxmi, mother of the prosecutrix as other witnesses are formal witnesses. PW2 the minor victim/prosecutrix/complainant is the star material witness and on her statement the present case FIR was registered. In her testimony before the court, she did not support her allegations as leveled by her in her statements to police as well as before ld. MM. On the contrary, PW1 deposed that in the summer of 2013 at about 01. 00 p. m. , while she was talking to the accused Dilip on the mobile phone sent by him, her parents noticed the same and gave beatings to her daughter/ prosecutrix. PW1 further stated that she saw the accused making some gesture with his hand towards the prosecutrix. However, in her cross-examination, PW1 admitted that her daughter had voluntarily taken mobile phone from the accused due to which she gave beatings to her daughter/prosecutrix. She admitted that her daughter was talking to the accused voluntarily and thereafter, she scolded her. She also admitted that it was the accused who had made call at 100 number after seeing that she was beating her daughter. She admitted that she did not make any call or complaint to the police. 11. Upon perusal of the testimony of both the material witnesses i. e. PW1 Smt. Laxmi and PW2 prosecutrix, I am of the considered opinion that both the material witnesses are totally hostile to the case of prosecution and have failed to prove the ingredients of offence u/s 509 IPC and u/s 12 POCSO Act against the accused. There is not even an iota of evidence to prove the ingredients of the aforesaid offences so as to make the case of prosecution stand on its own legs. Thus, prosecution miserably failed to prove its case against the accused and therefore, accused is entitled for acquittal. Therefore, I acquit the accused Dilip of the offences for which he has been charged with in the present case. Accused is on bail. His bail bond stands cancelled and surety is discharged. 12. However, accused is directed to furnish Personal Bond and Surety Bond u/s 437-A Cr. PC in sum of Rs. 10, 000/- each for a period of six months, within a week from today. 13. File be consigned to Record Room after due compliance. Announced in the open court today on 24th September, 2015 (SIDHARTH SHARMA) Addl. Sessions Judge-01 & Spl.

petitioner/the accused in Crime No. 114 of 2021 of Cherupuzha
Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Section
306 of Indian Penal Code, Sections 4 read with Section 3(a), 12
read with 11(iv) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
Sections 3(1), (W), 3(2)(V) of Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe
Prevention of Atrocities Act and Section 67B of Information
Technology Act.
The petitioner has been in custody since 16. 06. 2021.
The prosecution case is that a minor girl aged 17
years who belongs to Scheduled Caste community, the daughter of
the informant's uncle, was found dead on 09. 06. 2021. She was
found hanging in her bedroom in the wee hours of 09. 06. 2021.
Though she was rushed to the hospital by the relatives including
the informant, she was declared dead. A crime was registered
under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thereafter
postmortem examination was conducted on the body of the
deceased in the Medical College, Pariyaram where it was found by
the doctor who conducted the autopsy that she was subjected to
penetrative sexual assault. Then case was registered under
Sections 376(2) of IPC and Section 3(a) read with Section 4 of the
Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. Subsequently,
investigation has started and thus the sections have been altered
as aforementioned.
According to the learned appearing for the petitioner,
he has been falsely implicated in the case at the instance of some
of his friends who are on inimical terms with him. Absolutely he
has no role in the alleged incident and he never abetted the girl to
commit suicide at any point of time as alleged by the prosecution.
He has also not committed any kind of sexual abuse or harassment
as alleged, still he is undergoing unnecessary incarceration and
hence, this application.
Per contra, the learned Additional Director General of
Prosecution vehemently opposed the application. It was pointed
out that this petitioner came in contact with the deceased through
Facebook. Thereafter he managed to develop intimacy with the
minor girl by making frequent calls and also sending messages.
When the intimacy had developed, he used to take the victim girl to
various places and started to abuse her sexually. When the minor
girl was residing along with her grandmother he had even
approached her and stayed at their house by making them to
believe that he would marry her when she attains the age of
majority. In fact, the mobile phone which was found in the
possession of the minor child was presented by this petitioner so as
to trap her in the relationship, so as to satisfy his lust. He was
working as a bus conductor and he exploited the innocence of this
girl by making frequent calls and messages and she had even
forwarded her nude photographs to him as instigated by him, and
he had sex with this minor girl quite frequently. But later when she
made the request to marry her, he had deviated from his promise
and had tried to keep away from her and in fact his reluctance or
refusal to marry her, had led her to commit suicide and thus he
abetted her to commit suicide on 09. 06. 2021, is the argument
advanced by the learned ADGP.
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well
the learned ADGP. Perused the CD file.
As mentioned earlier, the records would reveal that the
case was actually registered under Section 174 of the Cr. P. C. ,
on 09. 06. 2021. Later, on receipt of the postmortem report, the
police has investigated the case and then it was revealed that her
death was because of the involvement of some perpetrator and
when the call details of her mobile phone were collected by the
investigating agency, it unfolded the mysterious relationship of this
petitioner with the deceased. Thereafter further investigation by
recording the statements of the relatives, friends and others who
are closely connected with the deceased was conducted and then
only it was realized that this petitioner was taking advantage of his
intimacy with her and he had abused her sexually though she was a
minor girl. The CD file further reveals that he used to visit her
quite often and sent obscene messages to her and prompted her to
send her nude photographs after giving a false promise that he
would marry her in near future. So, she was having close
acquaintance with him and it was exploited by him for having
sexual relationship with her. She was residing along with her
grandmother and he had visited her at that house and even stayed
with her under that false promise of marriage. The last visit of this
petitioner to her residence was on 13. 02. 2021. As the petitioner
had indulged in instigating her to commit suicide, the investigating
agency has to probe into the details of the mysterious death, to
collect more materials for the prosecution to prove the case.
It is also pointed out by the learned ADGP that this
petitioner, who was working as a bus conductor was having another
case of similar nature, registered in the year 2015. In that case
also, he adopted the very same modus operandi to get
acquaintance with a minor child and thereafter used her for his
sexual lust. That case is also pending for trial before the court
concerned. Since the investigating agency requires more time to
collect the entire evidence for the prosecution, I find that granting

PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI. AMJAD ALI THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 12. 10. 2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER This application is filed under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. 2. The applicant herein is the 1 st accused in Crime No. 487 of 2018 registered at the Puthenvelikkara Police Station under Sections 376(2)(f)(l) r/w. Section 34 of the IPC, Section 3, 4, 5(n) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 3. The survivor in the instant case is the daughter of Sri. Madhu M. R. , the elder brother of the applicant, who died on 26. 11. 2016 after a prolonged bout of illness. Sri. Madhu M. R. had divorced his wife in the year 2012 and thereafter, the children were allegedly residing with their father. After the death of Sri. Madhu M. R. , a petition was filed before the Judicial Magistrate, Paravur by the survivor and her mother seeking a residence order under Section 12 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. The respondents in the said petition are the applicant and his aged mother. In the said petition, which was filed in the year 2017, among other allegations, it was stated that the child and her brother were residing with their father till his death. While her father was not at home, the applicant and his friends used to behave in a salacious manner and used to look at the child with lustful eyes. Though she used to complain to her grandmother, instead of reprimanding the 1st accused, the victim used to be physically abused. On these allegations, a prayer was made to permit her mother to reside in the parental home of the father of the victim. On receipt of the said application, the learned Magistrate noticed that the petition contained allegations of sexual abuse on a minor child and decided to report the offence as envisaged under Section 19 of the POCSO Act. On receipt of the said memorandum dated 4. 9. 2018, a Crime was registered as aforesaid. The statement of the child was recorded by the Sub Inspector of Police, Women Cell. In her statement, which was recorded on 6. 9. 2018, she levelled very serious allegations against the applicant. She stated that on October, 2016 while she was not at home, the applicant came and sat next to her and touched her body with sexual intent. She spurned his advances and went to her room. He is alleged to have entered her bedroom and subjected her to penetrative sexual intercourse. After committing the act, he left the room. According to the child, though she narrated all these aspects to her father, he did not believe her words. The applicant herein was arrested on 19. 9. 2018 and he remains in custody. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that this is a classic case of abuse of provisions of the Act. In the petition filed seeking relief under the Domestic Violence Act, all that the child had stated was that the applicant used to behave in an inappropriate manner. She did not even have a case that the applicant touched her body let alone commit sexual intercourse. The learned Magistrate, thereafter considered the application and refused the prayer for a residence order. According to the learned counsel, the father of the child was extremely sick and neither the mother nor the children used to visit him. If there was any truth in the allegations, nothing prevented the mother or the child to level such allegations in the application filed before the learned Magistrate. The learned counsel has referred to Annexure-I petition filed under the Domestic Violence Act and Annexure-II order passed by the learned Magistrate. 5. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor and I have gone through the case diary. 6. It is borne out from Annexure-II order that the father of the victim had divorced the mother of the child in the year 2012. Annexure-I petition seeking a residence order is filed by the victim and her mother before the learned Magistrate. Nowhere in Annexure-I has it been mentioned that the child was raped by the applicant. The learned Magistrate had refused a residence order by order dated 7. 3. 2018. It is much later, on 6. 9. 2018, that an embellished version of the incident has been furnished by the child. In the 164 statement of the child recorded by the learned Magistrate, the child has reiterated the allegations. However, there are enough materials in the case diary which casts serious doubts as regards the veracity of the serious allegations levelled by the child against her uncle. The medical examination report also does not show that there is history of vaginal penetration. Furthermore, the applicant herein has been in custody from 19. 9. 2018 and in the facts and circumstances, I do not think that his further incarceration in custody is warranted. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs. 1, 00, 000/- (Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on every Saturdays between 10 a. m. and 1 p. m. , for a period of 3 months from today or till the final report is filed, whichever is earlier. 2). He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. He shall not make any attempt to contact the victim or her family members. 3). He shall not commit any offence while on bail. 4). He shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, the applicant shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

THIS CRL. P FILED U/S. 439 CR. P. C PRAYING TO ENLARGE THE PETITIONER ON BAIL IN CR. NO. 333/2019 (SPL. C. C. NO. 81/2020) REGISTERED BY DEVARAJEEVANAHALLI POLICE STATION, BENGALURU FOR THE OFFENCE PUNISHABLE UNDER SECTIONS 376 AND 506 OF IPC AND SECTIONS 5(2)(N) AND 6 OF POCSO ACT.
THIS CRL. P COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCE, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING:
Petitioner is the step-father of the victim aged about 13 years. FIR came to be registered against the petitioner based on the information lodged by Smt. Gunasheela, attached to Child Line, Bengaluru. In the complaint, it was alleged that the victim was studying in VII Standard at Nehru Centenary English School, Kanakanagar, Bengaluru. The parents of the victim were separated for the past five years and her mother got remarried to the petitioner/accused and was residing at Kanakanagar. The mother of the victim was an alcoholic and after she went to sleep, the petitioner/accused used to sexually abuse the victim for the past two years and threatened her not to disclose the same to anyone. In the complaint, it was stated that the victim narrated her plight to her friends and as per their advice, she called the Child Helpline and reported the matter to the complainant.
2. Sri. Tomy Sebastian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner contends that the victim in her statement given to the Magistrate under section 164 of Cr. P. C. , has unequivocally stated that she was in love with a boy by name Sameer. Her father namely the petitioner/accused saw them and as she needed freedom, by mistake, her father was implicated. Learned Magistrate failed to consider this statement and has rejected the application filed by the petitioner solely on the ground that the offences alleged against the petitioner are severe and are punishable upto life imprisonment.
3. Learned HCGP appearing for respondent however opposed the petition contending that the petitioner is involved in a serious offence under the provisions of POCSO Act and therefore he is not entitled for grant of bail.
4. I have considered the submissions and have perused the records.
5. The offences charged against the petitioner are punishable under sections 5(n) and 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 and under sections 376 and 506 of IPC. In the statement given by the victim under section 161 of Cr. P. C. , the victim has categorically implicated the petitioner herein and has stated that after her mother used to go to sleep, after getting heavily drunk, the petitioner used to sexually abuse her since the past two years. She has also narrated that she herself informed the matter to the Child Helpline through the mobile phone of one Smt. Priya, mother of her classmate. The complainant has also narrated that on getting the information over the phone, she visited the school where the victim was studying and on ascertaining that she was a victim of sexual offence, lodged the report before the D. J. Halli Police, whereafter the victim was subjected to medical examination and the accused was also arrested and subjected to medical examination.
6. The medical report produced along with the charge sheet indicates that as on the date of the examination of the victim, she was aged about 13 years. She had reached menarche. Her hymen was not intact. All these facts prima facie go to show that she was a victim of sexual assault. Unfortunately, in her statement given before the learned Magistrate under section 164 of Cr. P. C. , the victim stated thus:
"I have come to the court with my mother. I will give statement in front of my mother. I am aware of Kannada language very little and I can speak English. It is my mistake, first of all I did love with one boy Sameer. My father saw. I needed freedom to meet that boy. It all my mistake. I saw in T. V. about Hyderabad i. e. , about Priyanka. I am feeling guilty. Its all of my mistake please leave my father. My father nothing he did I wanted freedom to meet them. Hence, I said to the police like that. That's all. "
Though this statement is contrary to the previous statements made by the victim before the Police and the complainant, yet, solely on that ground, the petitioner cannot be enlarged on bail as he is otherwise not entitled to bail having regard to the inter se relationship and the manner in which the victim is alleged to have been subjected to sexual offence. Though in her statement recorded under section 164 of Cr. P. C. , she has stated that she was in love with Sameer, there is no material on record to show that she was sexually abused by him. No doubt, learned Magistrate has not adverted to the statement of the victim recorded under section 164 of Cr. P. C. , but there being other evidence on record, it is not proper for this Court to jump to the conclusion that the statement made by the victim under section 164 of Cr. P. C. is truthful and free of any force or coercion. The circumstances that drove the victim to make contradictory statements before the Police as well as before the Magistrate needs to be enquired into. Likewise, the facts and circumstances which made the victim to implicate her father also are required to be determined, which could be done only in a free atmosphere free of lurking threat, coercion or influence by the petitioner or any other close relatives of the victim.
7. Undeniably, the victim has been residing in the house of the petitioner/accused along with her mother. Under the said circumstances, if the petitioner is enlarged on bail at this juncture, possibility of the petitioner/accused threatening or influencing or prevailing upon the victim cannot be ruled out, which may prejudice the case of the prosecution and the possibility of ascertaining the actual truth will also be affected. Hence, I am of the view that until the victim is examined by the Trial Court, the petitioner cannot be admitted to bail.
For the above reasons, the petition is rejected. However, having regard to the facts and circumstances narrated above, the Trial Court is directed to examine the victim as expeditiously as possible, preferably through Video Conference and in the event the victim stands by the statement made by her under section 164 Cr. P. C. , the Trial court shall enlarge the petitioner on bail, on such terms and conditions as found expedient.

[case 40]
Jibitha vs Diyol on 28 January, 2020. The petitioner is the respondent in I. A. No. 1162/2019 in GOP No. 467/2019, on the file of Family Court, Trissur. The respondent in this original petition had filed the above application seeking interim custody of his minor son Dhanvin and permission to interact with his younger son Sidharth during holidays and vacation periods. In the application filed before the Family Court, the respondent had, inter alia, pleaded that, after the birth of the younger child, the petitioner refused to return to the matrimonial home. Subsequently, there was a mediation, and a rapprochement was effected. Immediately after conceiving the younger child, the petitioner went to her parental home and thereafter, has refused to resume co-habitation. The respondent is anxious to look after the welfare of the children, but the petitioner is not permitting the same. Therefore, interim custody of the older child may be given to him, and he be permitted to interact with the younger child. The application was opposed by the petitioner, who filed a written objection, inter alia, contending that the respondent is an alcoholic. Subsequent to the separation between them, there was a settlement before the Police, and the older child was agreed to be given on every Friday. However, the respondent's close friend Jayesh abused the child, and on a complaint by the petitioner, Crime No. 93/2019 was registered by the Guruvayoor Police Station, for offences punishable under POCSO Act and under Section 377 of IPC against Jayesh. Hence custody of the child shall not be given to the petitioner. The petitioner hence prays that the application may be dismissed. The Family Court after considering the application and the counter filed, and also after interacting with the child, who did not raise any complaint against the father, held that by merely raising allegations of sexual assault against the respondent's friend, the respondent cannot be restricted from having interim custody and visitation rights of his children. Accordingly, the Family Court allowed I. A. No. 1162/2019 by granting interim custody of the older child to the respondent from 11 a. m. of every 2nd Saturday till 3 p. m. on the following Sunday, with visitation right from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. Likewise, the respondent was permitted to interact with the younger child from 10 am to 11 am on every 2nd Saturday and from 11 am to 1 pm on every 4th Sunday. It is challenging the above order this original petition is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, contending that the impugned order passed by the Family Court is erroneous and improper and is liable to be set aside. This Court in Suhara and Others v. Muhammed Jaleel [2019 (2) KLT 960] has held that, even if one of the parents is accused of an allegation in a crime under the POCSO Act, is no assurance to a Family court that the allegation is true. The Court has to consider the paramount welfare and interest of the child while granting custody of the child to such parent, and further that the registration of the crime is not a bar in granting the parent access and visitation right of the child. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Anjali Kapoor vs. Rajiv Baijal [(2009) 7 SCC 322] has categorically declared the law that in a battle for custody of the child, Court should see what would best serve the welfare and interest of the child, which is the soul and predominant criteria and not the legal rights of the warring parents. In a most recent decision by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Yashita Sahu vs State of Rajasthan and others [2020 SCC OnLine (SC) 50] rendered on 20. 1. 2020, has declared as follows: 'The child is the victim in custody battles. In this fight of egos and increasing acrimonious battles and litigations between two spouses, our experience shows that more often than not, the parents who otherwise love their child, present a picture as if the other spouse is a villain and he or she alone is entitled to the custody of the child. The court must therefore be very vary of what is said by each of the spouses. A child, especially a child of tender years requires the love, affection, company, protection of both parents. This is not only the requirement of the child but is his/her basic human right. Just because the parents are at war with each other, does not mean that the child should be denied the care, affection, love or protection of any one of the two parents. A child is not an inanimate object which can be tossed from one parent to the other. Every separation, every re-union may have a traumatic and psychosomatic impact on the child. Therefore, it is to be ensured that the court weighs each and every circumstance very carefully before deciding how and in what manner the custody of the child should be shared between both the parents. Even if the custody is given to one parent the other parent must have sufficient visitation rights to ensure that the child keeps in touch with the other parent and does not lose social, physical and psychological contact with any one of the two parents. It is only in extreme circumstances that one parent should be denied contact with the child. Reasons must be assigned if one parent is to be denied any visitation rights or contact with the child. Courts dealing with the custody matters must while deciding issues of custody clearly define the nature, manner and specifics of the visitation rights. ' Undisputedly, in the present case the allegation is that, the respondent's friend and neighbour attempted to abuse the child and he is accused in POCSO case, therefore, the child shall not be given to the respondent. In view of the categoric declaration of law in the authoritative precedents cited supra, we are unable to accept the contentions that the handing over of the custody of the older child to the respondent would be detrimental to the paramount welfare and best interest of the older child, and that the respondent should be denied visitation rights of the younger child. The learned Judge of the Family Court had interacted with the older child and found that he has no complaint to go with his father and that there is no harm if the older child is being sent with the father on every 2nd Saturday till the following Sunday. Similarly, the father has been given visitation right to see the younger child also on every 2nd Saturday and 4th Sunday. The granting of interim custody and visitation rights would only benefit their paramount welfare and best interest. It is the welfare of the children that is to be looked into and not the rights and defences of the quarrelling parents. We do not find any ground warranting interference with the impugned order invoking the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The original petition is without merit. Accordingly, the Original Petition is dismissed.

On the basis of the said report, the police registered the offence against the accused persons and they were arrested. 4.

Lastly, it is submitted that the charge sheet has been filed, they are in jail since 20. 05. 2024 and the trial is likely to take some time, they are ready and willing to comply with any of the conditions which may be imposed upon them and thus, it is submitted that the application be allowed and the applicants be released on bail. 6.

Here in the present case, though the applicant had denied to have made any physical relation with the prosecutrix but considering the fact that it was not the first occasion when the complaint was made by the prosecutrix for committing rape but in the same vein she made similar type of allegations against other persons also. Thus, taking into consideration the fact that they are in jail since 20. 05. 2024, charge sheet has been filed and that the final disposal of the trial is likely to take sufficiently long time, the present applications deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, their bail applications are allowed. 10.

Madhya Pradesh High Court Nikhil Sarathe vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 28 August, 2018 1 M. Cr. C. No. 16856 of 2017 HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH PRINCIPAL SEAT AT JABALPUR Single Bench: Hon'ble Shri Rajeev Kumar Dubey, J. Misc. Criminal Case No. 16856/2017 Nikhil Sarathe vs. State of M. P. and Others -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shri Alok Bagrecha and Shri Pushpendra Dubey, learned counsel for the applicant. Shri Manish Awasthi, Govt. Advocate for the respondent/State. Shri Vivek Agrawal, learned counsel for the respondent no. 2/prosecutrix. None for the respondent No. 3/complainant though served. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ORDER Reserved on: 21/08/2018 Delivered on: /08/2018 This petition has been filed under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. seeking quashing of the F. I. R. of crime No. 293/2016 registered at PS Kotwali Bhopal for the offence punishable under Sections 363, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4 of POCSO Act and consequential proceedings thereto. Brief facts of the case are that on 29/12/2016, the father of the prosecutrix lodged a report at P. S. Kotwali Bhopal averring that his daughter (prosecutrix) age about 17 years was not at home since six 'o'clock in the morning and she was not found even after enough search. Someone had abducted her. On that police registered crime No. 293/16 for the offence punishable under section 363 of I. P. C. and investigated the matter and during investigation on 23/01/17 police rescued the prosecutrix from the custody of applicant and recorded the statement of the prosecutrix. In her statement prosecutrix stated that she had known applicant Nikhil for the last five years and there was a love affair between them. On 29th December 2016, Nikhil had asked him to escape from the house in order to marry with him. On this, around 5-6 o'clock in the morning without informing her family members she went to the Hawa Mahal, where she met Nikhil who took her to Arya Samaj Mandir situated at Nehru Nagar, where both of them got married, then they went to Shirdi where they stayed for four or five days. Thereafter they came back to Bhopal and stayed there for 5-6 days at Nikhil's friend's house situated at Neelbad area in Bhopal. During that period Nikhil also made physical relationship with her, after which Nikhil's friend Shubham (co-accused) took them to Jabalpur, where they stayed in the house of a person, who happened to be an acquaintance of Shubham, as a guest for 6-7 days. There too applicant Nikhil Had sex with her four to five times. On that police also added offences under section 368, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4, 5, 6, 11 (i) and 12 of POCSO Act and after investigation of the crime police filed charge-sheet against the applicant. On that charge-sheet S. T. No. 28/18 was registered. Applicant is facing trial in that case before 7 th A. S. J. Bhopal and filed this petition for quashing the F. I. R. of the crime No. 293/16 registered at P. S. Kotwali Bhopal and the proceedings of S. T. No. 28/18. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that the prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with the applicant on her own will. In the birth certificate of the prosecutrix, her date of birth is mentioned as 30/11/1998. According to that certificate, prosecutrix was major at the time of incident. The prosecutrix in her statement recorded by the JMFC under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. also deposed that she went with the applicant at her own will and she had married with applicant and is living with him. Since prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with applicant own her on will, no offences under Section 363, 376, 120-B, 212 of IPC and Section 3, 4 of POCSO Act is made out against the applicant. He further submitted that if it is assumed that the age of the prosecutrix was 17 years two months at the time of incident as appears on the basis of school entry register produced by the prosecution along with the charge sheet even then no offence is made out against the applicant from the charge-sheet because prosecutrix went with the applicant on her own will. In this regard, he also placed reliance on Delhi High Court judgment passed in Laxmi Devi & Anr. ; Maha Dev & Devender @ Babli v. State reported in (2012) DLT 619 and Apex Court judgment passed in Satish Mehra Vs. State reported in 2013 CrLJ 411, Rajeev Thaper Vs. Madan Lal reported in (2013) 3 SCC 330 and Independent thought Vs. Union of India reported in (2017) 10 SCC 800, and State of Karnataka Vs. L. Muniswamy and others reported in 1977 CRLJ 1125. Learned counsel for the prosecutrix also submitted that prosecutrix was major at the time of incident and went with the applicant on her own will and at present she is living with the applicant and also married with the him, so offence registered against the applicant should be quashed. Learned counsel for the State opposed the prayer and submitted that according to school entry register the date of birth of the prosecutrix is 23/10/1999 and on that basis the age of the prosecutrix was below 18 years at the time of incident i. e. 29/12/16 and she was minor at the time of incident. Applicant abducted the prosecutrix and made sexual relations with her, so offence under Section 368, 376 of IPC and Section 3/ 4 and 12 of POCSO is clearly made out against the applicant and prays for rejection of petition. This Court has gone through the record and arguments put forth by the learned counsel for both the parties. In the entry of school register, the date of prosecutrix is mentioned 23/10/1999 and on that basis the age of the prosecutrix appears to be below 18 years at the time of incident i. e. 29/12/16 and she was minor at the time of incident. Applicant took the prosecutrix and made sexual relations with her. So from the charge sheet offence under section 3/4 of the POCSO Act is prima facie made out against the applicant. So FIR and the proceedings of S. T. No. 28/18 can not be quashed at this stage. Although applicant produced Birth certificate of the prosecutrix in which the date of birth of prosecutrix is mentioned as 30/11/1998 but authenticity of that certificate has to be tested and it requires evidence to decide. Applicant is free to raise this issue before trial court at the appropriate stage and produce the evidence in support of his defence which will consider by the trial court on merits. Accordingly, petition is disposed of. (Rajeev Kumar Dubey) Judge vs Digitally signed by VARSHA SINGH Date: 2018. 08. 29 17: 55: 33 +05'30'

[case 44]
1. The appellant Raju Kumar Singh has challenged the legality and correctness of a judgment dated 19. 08. 2015 of learned Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 72/14 arising out of FIR No. 166/14 registered at Police Station Shalimar Bagh by which he was held guilty for committing offence punishable under Section 342 IPC and Sections 10 and 12 of POCSO Act. By an order dated 25. 08. 2015, he was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five years with fine `5, 000/- under Section 10 of POCSO Act; Rigorous Imprisonment for two months with fine `500/- under Section 342 IPC; and, Rigorous Imprisonment for one year with fine `1, 000/- under Section 12 of POCSO AC. The sentences were to operate concurrently.
2. The incident whereby the child was sexually abused was reported to the police via Daily Diary (DD) No. 87B (Ex. PW-3/A) on 21. 02. 2014 at around 10. 50 p. m. The Investigating Officer after recording the statement of victim's mother (Ex. PW-4/A) lodged First Information Report. The prosecutrix was medically examined; she recorded her 164 Cr. P. C. statement. The accused was arrested. Statements of witnesses conversant with the facts were recorded. Upon completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the appellant for commission of various offences in the court. To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses. The appellant denied his involvement in the crime and pleaded false implication; he did not produce any evidence in defence. The trial resulted in his conviction as aforesaid. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied, the instant appeal has been filed.
3. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the file. The occurrence took place during daytime at around 3. 30 p. m. when victim's mother Manju was away at her place of work. When she returned in the evening at around 8. 30 p. m. , the victim narrated the incident to her. She immediately went to the appellant's house but he was not present there. On his arrival at around 10. 00-10. 30 p. m. , she confronted and slapped him. The incident was reported immediately to the police and DD No. 87-B came into existence. In her statement (Ex. Pw-4/A), Manju gave a detailed account as to how and in what manner, her daughter 'X' (changed name) aged around five years was sexually assaulted by the appellant in her absence. The appellant was named in the FIR to be the perpetrator of the crime. In 164 Cr. P. C. statement (Ex. PW-2/F), the victim disclosed that the accused had taken her inside his room and had touched her private parts. She further disclosed that the accused had put off her underwear and had touched her private parts with tongue. In her 164 Cr. P. C. statement (Ex. PW-2/B), the complainant Manju also reiterated her version given to the police at first instance and implicated the accused to be the author of the crime.
4. Before recording her Court statement, the victim was asked various questions to find out if she was able to give rational answers to the questions put to her. The Presiding Officer after recording satisfaction that 'X' was competent to give her statement voluntarily, recorded her statement. She categorically attributed specific role to the accused in outraging her modesty in his house. She deposed that the accused had put off his underwear; he had also put off her underwear and touched her private parts; he had shown her nude photos on his mobile and had touched her private parts with his tongue. In the cross-examination, she disclosed that on the arrival of her mother, she apprised her about the occurrence. She further elaborated that the accused had done 'gandi baat' with her sister too and had shown her nude photos. She denied if the statement given by her in the court was tutored by her mother.
5. PW-4 (Manju), victim's mother corroborated her version in its entirety without any major variation. The statement of 'Y' (assumed name), victim's sister, was recorded as CW-1. In her statement 'Y' too deposed that the accused had taken her inside his house along with her sister 'X'; had shown her nude photos on his mobile; had disrobed her sister 'X'; and, had put off his underwear. In the cross-examination, she denied if she had given statement at the behest of her parents.
6. On scanning the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that they are consistent throughout and despite cross-examination, nothing material could be extracted to disbelieve them. The witnesses had no ulterior motive to falsely implicate the accused for the heinous offence. They have corroborated each other without any inconsistencies and infirmities. The incident was reported without delay and the appellant was named to be the perpetrator of the crime. Specific and defined role was assigned to him. The accused taking advantage of the loneliness of the small children in the house had dared to outrage their modesty. It has come on record that victim's father Sunil was confined in Tihar Jail in a decoity case. Her mother used to go at her place of work during the daytime. It gave an opportunity to the appellant living in the neighborhood to exploit the innocence of the children. In the absence of any prior animosity or enmity, the victims and their mother are not expected to falsely implicate the appellant in a case of sexual abuse to bring themselves in disrepute. The defense put up by the accused deserves outright rejection. Nothing has come on record to show if on any particular date `10, 000/- were borrowed by victim's father from him or that to avoid the said payment, the accused was falsely implicated in this case. For a trivial issue over return of money, the victim's parents are not expected to use their kids.
7. The Trial Court has discussed all the relevant aspects and the impugned order based upon fair appraisal of the evidence deserves no intervention. Sentence order is based upon fair reasoning and warrants no interference except that default sentence for non-payment of the fine shall be Simple Imprisonment for two months instead of nine months and fifteen days in all. Other terms and conditions of the sentence order are left undisturbed.

Sentence order is based upon fair reasoning and warrants no interference except that default sentence for non-payment of the fine shall be Simple Imprisonment for two months instead of nine months and fifteen days in all. Other terms and conditions of the sentence order are left undisturbed.

[case 46]
1. The appellant Raju Kumar Singh has challenged the legality and correctness of a judgment dated 19. 08. 2015 of learned Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Case No. 72/14 arising out of FIR No. 166/14 registered at Police Station Shalimar Bagh by which he was held guilty for committing offence punishable under Section 342 IPC and Sections 10 and 12 of POCSO Act. By an order dated 25. 08. 2015, he was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for five years with fine `5, 000/- under Section 10 of POCSO Act; Rigorous Imprisonment for two months with fine `500/- under Section 342 IPC; and, Rigorous Imprisonment for one year with fine `1, 000/- under Section 12 of POCSO AC. The sentences were to operate concurrently.
2. The incident whereby the child was sexually abused was reported to the police via Daily Diary (DD) No. 87B (Ex. PW-3/A) on 21. 02. 2014 at around 10. 50 p. m. The Investigating Officer after recording the statement of victim's mother (Ex. PW-4/A) lodged First Information Report. The prosecutrix was medically examined; she recorded her 164 Cr. P. C. statement. The accused was arrested. Statements of witnesses conversant with the facts were recorded. Upon completion of investigation, a charge-sheet was filed against the appellant for commission of various offences in the court. To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses. The appellant denied his involvement in the crime and pleaded false implication; he did not produce any evidence in defence. The trial resulted in his conviction as aforesaid. Being aggrieved and dissatisfied, the instant appeal has been filed.
3. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have examined the file. The occurrence took place during daytime at around 3. 30 p. m. when victim's mother Manju was away at her place of work. When she returned in the evening at around 8. 30 p. m. , the victim narrated the incident to her. She immediately went to the appellant's house but he was not present there. On his arrival at around 10. 00-10. 30 p. m. , she confronted and slapped him. The incident was reported immediately to the police and DD No. 87-B came into existence. In her statement (Ex. Pw-4/A), Manju gave a detailed account as to how and in what manner, her daughter 'X' (changed name) aged around five years was sexually assaulted by the appellant in her absence. The appellant was named in the FIR to be the perpetrator of the crime. In 164 Cr. P. C. statement (Ex. PW-2/F), the victim disclosed that the accused had taken her inside his room and had touched her private parts. She further disclosed that the accused had put off her underwear and had touched her private parts with tongue. In her 164 Cr. P. C. statement (Ex. PW-2/B), the complainant Manju also reiterated her version given to the police at first instance and implicated the accused to be the author of the crime.
4. Before recording her Court statement, the victim was asked various questions to find out if she was able to give rational answers to the questions put to her. The Presiding Officer after recording satisfaction that 'X' was competent to give her statement voluntarily, recorded her statement. She categorically attributed specific role to the accused in outraging her modesty in his house. She deposed that the accused had put off his underwear; he had also put off her underwear and touched her private parts; he had shown her nude photos on his mobile and had touched her private parts with his tongue. In the cross-examination, she disclosed that on the arrival of her mother, she apprised her about the occurrence. She further elaborated that the accused had done 'gandi baat' with her sister too and had shown her nude photos. She denied if the statement given by her in the court was tutored by her mother.
5. PW-4 (Manju), victim's mother corroborated her version in its entirety without any major variation. The statement of 'Y' (assumed name), victim's sister, was recorded as CW-1. In her statement 'Y' too deposed that the accused had taken her inside his house along with her sister 'X'; had shown her nude photos on his mobile; had disrobed her sister 'X'; and, had put off his underwear. In the cross-examination, she denied if she had given statement at the behest of her parents.
6. On scanning the testimonies of all these witnesses, it stands established that they are consistent throughout and despite cross-examination, nothing material could be extracted to disbelieve them. The witnesses had no ulterior motive to falsely implicate the accused for the heinous offence. They have corroborated each other without any inconsistencies and infirmities. The incident was reported without delay and the appellant was named to be the perpetrator of the crime. Specific and defined role was assigned to him. The accused taking advantage of the loneliness of the small children in the house had dared to outrage their modesty. It has come on record that victim's father Sunil was confined in Tihar Jail in a decoity case. Her mother used to go at her place of work during daytime. It gave an opportunity to the appellant living in the neighborhood to exploit the innocence of the children. In the absence of any prior animosity or enmity, the victims and their mother are not expected to falsely implicate the appellant in a case of sexual abuse to bring themselves in disrepute. The defense put up by the accused deserves outright rejection. Nothing has come on record to show if on any particular date `10, 000/- were borrowed by victim's father from him or that to avoid the said payment, the accused was falsely implicated in this case. For a trivial issue over return of money, the victim's parents are not expected to use their kids.
7. The Trial Court has discussed all the relevant aspects and the impugned order based upon fair appraisal of the evidence deserves no intervention. Sentence order is based upon fair reasoning and warrants no interference except that default sentence for non-payment of the fine shall be Simple Imprisonment for two months instead of nine months and fifteen days in all. Other terms and conditions of the sentence order are left undisturbed.

COURT: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD and HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)
Date: 09-01-2025
Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. The trial court records have been received.
This appeal against the judgment of acquittal has been preferred for setting aside the judgment dated 24. 02. 2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Rohtas at Sasaram in Sessions Trial No. 411 of 2018 arising out of Dehri Rohtas Mahila P. S. Case No.
The prosecution story is based on the written report submitted by Sunita Pandey, Prosecution Witness '5', which reads as under:
The informant states that she was married on 12. 06. 2010 in accordance with Hindu rites and customs with Binod Kumar Pandey. She claims that her father had given a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs in cash and other articles together by way of gift. She has further stated that for some time after the marriage, everything was going well, but later on her husband Binod Kumar Pandey, bhaishur Ashok Kumar Pandey, father-in-law Parshuram Pandey, nanad Urmila Devi and nandoi Shambhu Chaubey acting with preconcert of mind, started asking her to tell her father to purchase a piece of land in any of the towns in the State of Uttar Pradesh. She alleged that on her refusal to do so, all of them together started torturing her mentally and physically whereafter under compulsion, she told her father, thereafter her father got registered 1½ kattha of land in Siddharth Nagar Mohalla of Mughalsarai in the joint name of the informant and her husband. She alleged that the price of the land being Rs. 12 lakhs was paid by her father. She has further alleged that thereafter, for some time again, everything went well but once again, the accused persons started demanding a four-wheeler vehicle and for that she was being tortured in many ways. Her father was not able to meet the said demand. On 15. 03. 2018 her husband took her to Mughalsarai for showing under construction house where her Bhaishur Ashok Kumar Pandey was already present. At about 10: 00 PM, she asked her husband as to when they would return to Allahabad then her husband and bhaisur asked her to bring either a four-wheeler vehicle or allow her husband to solemnise a second marriage and for this, they demanded a written consent. She alleged that when she denied this, then she was assaulted and her neck was pressed by a towel ('gamchha') whereafter, she became unconscious. Thereafter, they left her thinking that she had died. The informant stated that when she regained consciousness then somehow concealing herself, she came out of the house and reached her maike, where her father took her to Sadar Hospital, Sasaram for treatment. She stated to have enclosed a xerox copy of the slips with her written application. Her father and brother went to her sasural to inquire into but they were abused and threatened that the situation will not change till the demand is fulfilled.
On the basis of the written report of the informant, Dehri Rohtas Mahila P. S. Case No. 20 of 2018 was registered on 21. 03. 2018. After investigation of the case, the Investigating Officer submitted a chargesheet under Section 307, 498A and 120B IPC. The learned ACJM, Sasaram took cognizance of the offence on 13. 08. 2018 whereafter the police papers were supplied and records were committed to the Court of Sessions. The accused persons were explained the charges which they denied and claimed to be tried. Accordingly, charges were framed against them for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 498A and 120B IPC. Against the rest of the accused, charges were framed under Sections 498A and 120B IPC. After framing of the charges, the accused, namely, Parshuram Pandey and Shambhu Choubey died during trial, therefore, only three accused faced trial. The learned trial court framed the following points for determination: (a) Whether the accused Ashok Kumar Pandey and Binod Kumar Pandey attempted to kill the informant Sunita Pandey at Mughalsarai on 15. 03. 2018 and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 307 IPC; (b) Whether the accused persons committed cruelty against the informant in connection with demand of dowry and thereby committed an offence under Section 498A IPC. The learned trial court examined the evidences available on the record and found that in the instant case, admittedly the marriage of the victim was solemnised with the accused Binod Kumar Pandey according to Hindu Rites and Customs. Regarding the demand of a plot in the State of Uttar Pradesh and supply of Rs. 12, 00, 000/- by victim's father, the prosecution examined the victim's father as PW-1 who stated in his cross-examination that he handed over the said money in cash but did not use to get acknowledgment for the same. The learned trial court found that according to his deposition, the accused used to harass his daughter since 2010 but he tendered the money after 5-6 years. Further, it was found that the victim has admitted in her cross-examination about the effort and expenditure made by her accused husband in her treatment for enabling her to get a child. The learned trial court, ultimately reached to a finding that the prosecution had failed to bring home all the necessary ingredients to convict the accused under Sections 307, 498A and 120B IPC. Accordingly, the learned trial court directed acquittal of the four accused persons who were facing the charges.

[case 48]
IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 13TH DAY OF OCTOBER 2017 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE BUDIHAL R. B. CRIMINAL PETITION No. 6011/2017 BETWEEN: Santosh S/o Venkateshappa Aged about 29 years R/at Anuru village Sidlaghatta taluk Chickballapur District-562 101. .. PETITIONER (By Sri A N Radha Krishna, Adv. ) AND: The State of Karnataka by Shidlaghatta Rural Police Chikkaballapura District Represented by the State Public Prosecutor High Court of Karnataka Bengaluru-560 001. .. RESPONDENT (By Sri Chetan Desai, HCGP) This criminal petition is filed under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in Cr. No. 53/2017 of Shidlagatta Rural P. S. , Chickballapura District for the offences punishable under Sections 504, 376D read with Section 34 of IPC and Section 4, 6, 8 of POCSO Act. Brief facts of the prosecution case are that on 10. 03. 2017 at 09. 30 a. m. , the respondent police received a phone call from Chikkaballapura Government Hospital and accordingly, the police went to the hospital and recorded the complainant Niveditha's statement before the Doctor. It is alleged in the statement that the victim is studying in first year B. Com. , at Chikkaballapura Pre-University College. Her mother died when she was young and she is residing with her father. Earlier when she was in her senior uncle Thimmarayppa's House, there was a call from her village person Santhosh (petitioner) phone 9663422243 to her Senior Uncle Thimmarayppa's Phone No. 87110009631. At that time, since her senior uncle Thimmarayppa was not in the house, she received and talked to him. Again, he telephoned and asked her to go near the temple under construction, for which, when she told that she will not come, he threatened and asked her to come. When the victim went there, he tried to remove/untie the chudidar and in spite of her request not to remove, he removed her clothes and sexually abused her and thereafter, he left to Bengaluru. It is further alleged that again one Naveen of her village has become close, used to talk with her. He took her near the temple and by removing chudidar and by force, sexually abused her. Again on 13. 6. 2016, the said Naveen forcibly made her to come and sexually abused. After her father came to know the same, advised her. It is alleged that on 07. 07. 2016, her father passed away. Her aunt got her admitted to BCM Hostel. It is stated that after Shivarathri festival, after noticing her womb, her aunt took her to the Doctor at Chikkaballapura on 25. 02. 2017 and Doctors told her, she is pregnant of 9 months and advised her to go to Swadhara Centre. Accordingly, her aunt got her admitted. On 03. 03. 2017, she gave birth to a male child. After discharge, she came to Chikkaballapura Hospital. On the basis of the said complaint, the case was registered by the respondent police for the said offences against the petitioner herein and one Naveen, who has been arrayed as accused No. 2. I have heard the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner-accused and the learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State. Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner, during the course of the arguments, submitted that for the purpose of appreciation of case, if the date of complaint is taken into consideration, it is filed after delay of two years. He submitted that the call details are not collected by the investigating officer. Even looking to the complaint averments, she has stated that one person called her over phone with particular number. It is submitted by the learned Counsel that in the complaint itself, the phone number is mentioned that subsequently, similar acts of sexual assault was made on her by one Naveen, who is accused No. 2. The learned Counsel draws the attention of the court to the materials and submitted that DNA test was conducted and the report of the laboratory goes to show that the petitioner is not involved in commission of the alleged offence. Hence, he submitted to allow the petition and admit the petitioner to the regular bail. Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State, opposed the petition and submitted that so far as the complaint averments and the other materials produced by the prosecution, there are allegations against the petitioner that he had called the victim girl to a particular place and had sexual intercourse with her. The learned HCGP submitted that though the DNA report, no doubt, shows the name of accused No. 2 as biological father of the said child, but in view of the allegations made in the complaint and other material collected during investigation, the petitioner is not entitled to the regular bail. Investigation of the case is completed and the charge sheet has been filed. As submitted by learned HCGP, in the DNA report, the name of accused NO. 2 Naveen is shown as the biological father of the said child. So far as the petitioner is concerned, he has denied the allegation made in the complaint and contended that he has been falsely implicated in the case and that, he is innocent. As it is rightly submitted that as per the complaint averments, one person was called the victim girl over the phone to a particular place and phone number is also mentioned. But the call details are not collected. The contention of the prosecution regarding the allegations of sexual assault on the victim girl by the petitioner is concerned, it is a matter of trial. From the date of arrest, he is in custody. In view of the finding given by the DNA test laboratory and denial of the allegations made by the petitioner and as submitted, there is delay of two years in lodging the complaint from the date of incident, so far as the petitioner is concerned, it is a fit case to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioner. Hence, the petition is allowed. The petitioner-accused No. 1 is ordered to be released on bail of the offences punishable under Sections 504, 376(d) read with Section 34 of IPC and also under Sections 4, 6 and 8 of POCSO Act registered in respondent police station Crime No. 53/2017, subject to following conditions: I. Petitioner shall execute bond for a sum of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- and shall offer one solvent surety for the like sum to the satisfaction of concerned Court. II. The petitioner shall not intimidate or tamper with prosecution witnesses, directly or indirectly. III. The petitioner shall regularly attend the Court.

RESPONDENT [BY SRI. K. NAGESHWARAPPA, HCGP] THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL IS FILED U/S 374(2) OF CR. P. C. , PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE JUDGMENT OF CONVICTION DATED 13. 12. 2018 AND ORDER ON SENTENCE DATED 15. 12. 2018 PASSED BY THE II ADDITIONAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS (SPECIAL) JUDGE D. K. , MANGALORE IN SPL. CASE NO. 207/2016, CONVICTING THE APPELLANT/ACCUSED FOR THE OFFENCE P/U/S 5(m) P/U/S 6 OF POCSO ACT. THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR FURTHER HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: JUDGMENT This is an appeal filed by the accused challenging the Judgment and Order dated 13. 12. 2018/15. 12. 2018 passed by the Court of II Additional District and Sessions [Special] Judge, D. K. , Mangaluru, in Special Case No. 207/2016, convicting and sentencing him for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 [hereinafter referred to as 'POCSO Act' for short]. The factual matrix of the case as put-forth by the prosecution is as under: A complaint was lodged by Smt. Vidya on 25. 07. 2016 at about 10. 00 p. m. , at Konaje Police Station against the accused. It is stated by the first informant that she and her husband are living along with their two children. Her husband was doing centering work. On 23. 07. 2016, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, aged about 4 years, her daughter asked her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. The first informant did not take it seriously. Again on the next day, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. Again in the afternoon when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her that she was having pain and burning sensation in her private part. When she enquired with her daughter, her daughter informed that on 23. 07. 2016 when she had gone to the house of the neighbour uncle [accused] for watching T. V. , at that time, he lifted her and inserted his finger on her private part and tickled her. Thereafter, at about 2. 00 p. m. , when the first informant and her daughter were in the front yard, at that time, her daughter showed the accused and told her that he is the one who took her inside the house and inserted the finger in her private part and tickled her. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint lodged by the mother of the victim girl, a case was registered in Crime No. 192/2016 of Konaje Police Station against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012, by P. W. 11 and he issued Ex. P6-FIR to the jurisdictional Court and thereafter handed over the investigation to P. W. 13-Police Inspector. P. W. 13 proceeded with the investigation and conducted spot-mahazar as per Ex. P2. The victim girl was sent for medical examination and her medical examination was conducted by P. W. 4. The statement of the victim girl was recorded by the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. The articles collected during the course of investigation were sent for forensic examination. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act. Initially, charges were framed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(b) and 4 of the POCSO Act on 27. 04. 2017. Additional charges were framed for the offence punishable under Sections 5(m) and 6 of the POCSO Act. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him and claimed to be tried. Before the trial Court, the prosecution got examined P. Ws. 1 to 15 and got marked Exs. P1 to 9 and M. O. 1. The accused denied all the incriminating evidence appeared against him while his statement was recorded under Section 313 of Cr. P. C. However, the accused did not choose to lead any evidence on his behalf. The learned Sessions Judge after considering the evidence and material on record, convicted and sentenced the accused for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been preferred. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant/accused has vehemently contended that the impugned Judgment and Order passed by the trial Court is opposed to law, facts and probabilities of the case. The trial Court has committed grave error in convicting the accused though the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. He submits that on account of previous enmity, a false complaint was lodged against the accused. There is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. The medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The victim has been tutored by her parents to give false evidence against the accused, which is evident from her cross-examination. He submits that the trial Court has erred in observing that the contradictions in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as in the testimony of an adult by ignoring the admission given by the victim that she was tutored by her mother to give evidence as deposed by her. He submits that the evidence of the victim girl clearly shows that she was acting under the influence of her parents and therefore, she is a tutored witness. Hence, it is not safe to act upon such evidence particularly when the medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the victim. He therefore submits that the impugned Judgment and Order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court be set aside and the appeal be allowed. .. The remaining text goes on to explain more specifics regarding the legal proceedings, testimonies, medical reports, and the final decision regarding the appeal.

[case 50]
Mr. X- Juvenile vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 4 April, 2023
HON'BLE SANJAY KUMAR PACHORI, J.
1. Heard Sri Shivam Yadav, Advocate holding brief of Sri Rajesh Yadav, learned counsel for the revisionist, Sri Ghanshyam Kesarwani, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the material available on record. Despite service of notice upon opposite party No. 2, none appears on his behalf.
2. The Present Criminal Revision has been preferred by the revisionist through his mother under Section 102 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as "JJ Act, 2015") against the judgment dated 24. 9. 2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act), Auraiya in Criminal Appeal No. 26 of 2022, whereby the appellate court has rejected the Criminal appeal and affirmed the order dated 29. 8. 2022 passed by Juvenile Justice Board, Auraiya. The Juvenile Justice Board has rejected the bail application of the revisionist, which has been filed by his natural guardian/mother, under Section 12 of "JJ Act, 2015" arising out of Case Crime No. 20 of 2022, under Sections 363, 366, 376, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code (in short "I. P. C. ") and Section 3/4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, Police Station- Bidhuna, District- Auraiya.
3. Learned counsel for the revisionist submits that the revisionist is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. The revisionist was 15 years, 1 month and 6 days old at the time of the incident. As per educational certificate, the Juvenile Justice Board declared the revisionist as juvenile vide order dated 29. 8. 2022 and no proceeding is pending against the aforesaid order. It is further submitted that the FIR has been lodged against the revisionist and three other named persons by father of the victim. It is further submitted that there is material contradictions in the statement of the victim recorded under Section 161 and 164 Cr. P. C. As per statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. , the victim has gone to the house of her friend in Kanpur and the father of the victim lodged false FIR against the revisionist. It is further submitted that as per educational certificate, victim was 14 years and 5 months old at the time of incident. As per medical report, no external or internal injury has been found on the person of the victim. Clothes have been changed due to which the clothes have not been collected during the investigation. The revisionist is in protective custody in an observation home since 25. 4. 2022.
4. It is further submitted that the finding recorded by the court below is against the social information report and is based on surmises and conjectures. It has been further submitted that there is no evidence to show that if the revisionist is released on bail, his release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal, or expose him to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or that his release would defeat the ends of justice. No such findings were recorded as to how he will come in contact with known criminals and how he will be exposed to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or that his release would defeat the ends of justice.
5. Learned counsel for the revisionist further submits that the revisionist has no criminal antecedent to his credit except the present case and is not a previous convict nor is he associated with any kind of unsocial or criminal activities. There is no report regarding any previous criminal antecedents of the family of the revisionist. The natural guardian/mother of the revisionist has given an undertaking that if the revisionist is released on bail, she will keep him in her custody and look after him properly and has assured on behalf of the juvenile that she is ready to cooperate with the process of law and shall faithfully make the juvenile available before the court whenever required and is also ready to accept all the conditions which the Court may deem fit.
6. It has been further submitted that the Juvenile Justice Board as well as the Appellate Court have not appreciated the Social Information Report of the Probation Officer in its right perspective and passed the impugned judgment and order in a cursory manner without considering the position of law and have declined bail to the revisionist. The bare perusal of the impugned orders demonstrates that the same has been passed on flimsy grounds, which have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice. The judgment and order passed by the learned court below are illegal, contrary to law, and is based on the erroneous assumption of facts and law.
7. Per contra; learned A. G. A. for the State defended the impugned judgment and order passed by the Appellate Court as well as the Juvenile Justice Board and contended that the revisionist has committed a heinous crime. Considering the gravity of the offence, the present criminal revision is liable to be dismissed.
8. I have carefully considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the revisionist and learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the material on record.
9. The bail application under Section 12 of "JJ Act, 2015" has been rejected by the Juvenile Justice Board vide order dated 29. 8. 2022 observing that there appears a reasonable ground for believing that the guardian of the juvenile has no effective control over the revisionist and there is a possibility of re-occurrence of the offence after his release. Furthermore, he has committed the heinous offence and indulged in this activity due to lack of discipline. The appellate court has also affirmed the order passed by the Juvenile Justice Board. The appellate court without considering the social information report of the Probation Officer in its right perspective as well as without returning any finding on the three exceptions declined the bail to the revisionist and rejected the appeal after observing that the parents of the juvenile are unable to keep the juvenile under control. There is a lack of availability of a consultant and if the juvenile is released on bail, he is likely to go into association with known criminals.

This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. , praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in Cr. No. 223/2020 of Ashok Nagar Police Station, Bengaluru City for the offence punishable under Section 376, 506 of IPC and Sections 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 of POCSO Act.
This Criminal Petition coming on for Orders, this day through Video Conference the Court made the following: ORDER The present petition has been filed by the petitioner/accused under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. to release him on bail in Crime No. 223/2020 of Ashoknagar Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC and also under Sections 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter referred to as 'the POCSO Act' for short).
I have heard Sri. T. K. Rajagopala, learned counsel for the petitioner/accused and Sri. R. D. Renukaradhya, learned High Court Government Pleader for respondent No. 1-State. Though the notice has been served to the complainant, she has remained absent.
The gist of the case of the complainant in brief is that the complainant is none other than the wife of the petitioner/accused. During the year 2009, they have got married and out of the said wedlock, they have begotten a female child. From 2010-19 they were staying in Tamil Nadu. During the year 2019, they came and started to reside in Bengaluru. It is further alleged that her husband is in the habit of watching porn videos in the mobile and he was also showing the same to the complainant and he used to assault, abuse and used to pull and push her daughter. On 08. 09. 2020, her victim daughter came and told her that when the complainant was not there in the house, the petitioner/accused being the father of the victim used to remove her pant and press her chest and was also showing porn videos in the mobile and ill-treat and harass. He was also threatening the victim that if she is not going to hear his words, he will put poison in the food and kill the victim and her mother. On the basis of the complaint, a case has been registered.
It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner/accused that the petitioner/accused is innocent and only with an intention to harass him, a false case has been registered by the wife of the accused. It is his further submission that the statement of the victim has been recorded under Sections 161 and 164 of Cr. P. C. There is no allegation for having sexually assaulted the victim. It is his further submission that provisions of Sections 4 and 5 of the POCSO Act and Section 376 of IPC are not attracted to the petitioner/accused. It is his further submission that already the investigation has been completed and charge sheet has been filed. The petitioner/accused is not required for the purpose of further investigation or interrogation. It is his further submission that the petitioner/accused is ready to abide by any of the conditions that may be imposed by this Court and ready to offer sureties. On these grounds, he prayed to allow the petition.
Per contra, learned High Court Government Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that the petitioner/accused being the father of the victim has sexually assaulted her by pressing her breast and was showing porn videos in his mobile. The said mobile has been seized by the Police. On these grounds, he prayed to dismiss the petition.
I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties and perused the charge sheet material.
On going through the statement of the victim, the material produced does not substantiate the fact to attract the provisions of Section 376 of IPC. Even the medical evidence is also not corroborated to the charge sheet material. The victim has been examined before the learned Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. but in the said statement also she has not specifically stated for having committed any sexual assault on her. Under such circumstances, the provisions of Sections 4 and 6 are also not attracted. At the most, the provision of Sections 7 and 8 are attracted and as per Section 8 of the POCSO Act, the offence is punishable with 5 years and also liable to be fine.
Taking into consideration of the above said circumstances, I am of the considered opinion that by imposing some stringent conditions if the petitioner/accused is released on bail, it is going to meet the ends of justice.
In that light, the petition is allowed and the petitioner/accused is ordered to be enlarged on bail in Crime No. Crime No. 223/2020 of Ashoknagar Police Station for the offence punishable under Sections 376 and 506 of IPC and also under Sections 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, subject to the following conditions; i) The petitioner/accused shall execute a personal bond for a sum of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) with two sureties for the likesum to the satisfaction of the trial Court.
ii) He shall not tamper with the prosecution evidence directly or indirectly.
iii) He shall not leave the jurisdiction of the Court without prior permission. iv) He shall mark his attendance once in 15 days of every month between 10: 00 a. m. and 5: 00 p. m. till the trial is concluded. v) He shall not indulge in similar type of criminal activities. If he again indulged in similar type of criminal activities or violates any one of the condition, the trial Court is at liberty to cancel the bail.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA KALABURAGI BENCH DATED THIS THE 14TH DAY OF MARCH, 2017 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE B. A. PATIL CRIMINAL PETITION No. 200301/2017 Between: 1.

Uploankar, Advocate for Sri Shivanand Patil, Advocate) And: The State through Manvi Police Station Represented by Addl. SPP High Court of Karnataka Kalaburagi Bench. .. Respondent (By Sri P. S. Patil, HCGP) This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. , praying to enlarge the petitioners on bail in Spl. FIR (POCSO) 10/2017 pending on the file of Additional Sessions Judge, Raichur, which is registered for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 109, 504, 307, 506 r/w Section 34 of IPC and also for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. This petition is coming on for Orders this day, the Court made the following: - ORDER This petition is filed by the petitioners/accused Nos. 2 and 3 under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. , seeking regular bail in Crime No. 22/2017 of Manvi Police Station, registered for the offences punishable under Sections 376, 109, 504, 307, 506 r/w Section 34 of IPC and also for the offences punishable under Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ('the Act' for short). Brief facts leading to filing of the complaint are that the victim has been brought up in the house of the complainant. Accused No. 1/child-in-conflict with law used to visit the house of his sister. In that light, on 24. 01. 2017 at about 9. 00 p. m. , the complainant received information by the people of that area to the effect that accused No. 1/child-in-conflict with law has outraged the modesty of the victim and she was screaming and immediately, she went to the house of Huligemma and through window she saw the child-in-conflict with law was undressed and was outraging the modesty of the victim. Despite shouting, he did not open the door and finally, he outraged the modesty of the victim and returned to home. Next day, when her husband came to home, the complainant narrated the incident to him and her husband called the petitioners over the phone and asked them to come over to the village to discuss about the incident. On 25. 01. 2017 at about 11. 00 p. m. , when the complainant was in the house, the accused persons came there by holding deadly weapons and started abusing her by saying that they wanted to grab the land belonging to the victim as such, they have got committed the said offence through accused No. 1. They have assaulted on the head of the complainant with stick and assaulted by hands. On hearing the noise, neighbors came and rescued her. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for respondent-State. The main grounds urged by Sri Avinash A. Uploankar, learned counsel appearing for Sri Shivanand Patil, learned counsel for the petitioners are that petitioners have been implicated in this case only with an intention to grab the property. The allegations made against the petitioners are that they have abetted accused No. 1 to commit the said crime and they have assaulted the complainant on the next day when they went to question about the alleged incident. There are no overt-acts so far as the other offences which have been committed by accused No. 1. He has also contended that the injured has been discharged from the hospital. He has further contended that petitioners have got both movable and immovable properties, therefore, there is no chance of they being absconded. He has also contended that if the petitioners are released on bail, they are ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this Court and they are ready to offer sureties. On these grounds, he prays for allowing the petition. On the contrary, learned High Court Government Pleader appearing for the respondent-State has vehemently contended that petitioners have abetted accused No. 1 to commit serious offence of sexual assault against the victim. He has also contended that at this juncture, if the petitioners are released on bail, they may tamper with the prosecution witnesses, they may abscond and they may not be available for trial. On these grounds, he prays for dismissal of the petition. I have gone through the contents of the complaint and other material produced along with the petition. On going through the contents of the complaint, it would indicate that at the first instance the alleged incident has taken place on 24. 01. 2017 by accused No. 1 who is considered to be child in conflict with law. He has been released on bail by the Juvenile Justice Board. The allegation made against the petitioners is that when they had been to the house of the complainant on 25. 01. 2017 at about 11. 00 p. m. , they have abused and assaulted the complainant with stick, hands and thereby, caused injuries. When the injured has been discharged from the hospital and when there are no serious allegations against the petitioners except the allegation of abetment, I feel that if the petitioners are released on bail by imposing stringent conditions, it would safeguard the interest of the prosecution and it would meet the ends of justice. For the aforementioned reasons, the petition is allowed and petitioners/accused Nos. 2 and 3 are ordered to be released on bail, subject to the following conditions: i) The petitioners shall execute personal bonds for a sum of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs Only) each with two solvent sureties each for the likesum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court; ii) The petitioners shall not indulge in hampering the investigation or tampering the prosecution witnesses; iii) The petitioners shall make themselves available to the Investigating Officer as and when required; iv) The petitioners shall appear before the Trial Court regularly on all the dates of hearing without fail. v) The petitioners shall not leave the jurisdiction of the concerned Court without its prior permission.

THIS CRIMINAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR FURTHER HEARING THIS DAY, THE COURT DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: JUDGMENT This is an appeal filed by the accused challenging the Judgment and Order dated 13. 12. 2018/15. 12. 2018 passed by the Court of II Additional District and Sessions [Special] Judge, D. K. , Mangaluru, in Special Case No. 207/2016, convicting and sentencing him for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 [hereinafter referred to as 'POCSO Act' for short]. The factual matrix of the case as put-forth by the prosecution is as under: A complaint was lodged by Smt. Vidya on 25. 07. 2016 at about 10. 00 p. m. , at Konaje Police Station against the accused. It is stated by the first informant that she and her husband are living along with their two children. Her husband was doing centering work. On 23. 07. 2016, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, aged about 4 years, her daughter asked her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. The first informant did not take it seriously. Again on the next day, when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her not to pour warm water on her private part as she was having burning sensation. Again in the afternoon when she was giving warm water bath to her daughter, she told her that she was having pain and burning sensation in her private part. When she enquired with her daughter, her daughter informed that on 23. 07. 2016 when she had gone to the house of the neighbour uncle [accused] for watching T. V. , at that time, he lifted her and inserted his finger on her private part and tickled her. Thereafter, at about 2. 00 p. m. , when the first informant and her daughter were in the front yard, at that time, her daughter showed the accused and told her that he is the one who took her inside the house and inserted the finger in her private part and tickled her. On the basis of the aforesaid complaint lodged by the mother of the victim girl, a case was registered in Crime No. 192/2016 of Konaje Police Station against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act, 2012, by P. W. 11 and he issued Ex. P6-FIR to the jurisdictional Court and thereafter handed over the investigation to P. W. 13-Police Inspector. P. W. 13 proceeded with the investigation and conducted spot-mahazar as per Ex. P2. The victim girl was sent for medical examination and her medical examination was conducted by P. W. 4. The statement of the victim girl was recorded by the Magistrate under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. The articles collected during the course of investigation were sent for forensic examination. After completion of the investigation, charge-sheet was filed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(a) and 4 of the POCSO Act. Initially, charges were framed against the accused for the offence punishable under Sections 3(b) and 4 of the POCSO Act on 27. 04. 2017. Additional charges were framed for the offence punishable under Sections 5(m) and 6 of the POCSO Act. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him and claimed to be tried. Before the trial Court, the prosecution got examined P. Ws. 1 to 15 and got marked Exs. P1 to 9 and M. O. 1. The accused denied all the incriminating evidence appeared against him while his statement was recorded under Section 313 of Cr. P. C. However, the accused did not choose to lead any evidence on his behalf. The learned Sessions Judge after considering the evidence and material on record, convicted and sentenced the accused for the offence under Section 5(m) punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Aggrieved by the same, the present appeal has been preferred. The learned counsel appearing for the appellant/accused has vehemently contended that the impugned Judgment and Order passed by the trial Court is opposed to law, facts and probabilities of the case. The trial Court has committed grave error in convicting the accused though the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubt. He submits that on account of previous enmity, a false complaint was lodged against the accused. There is an inordinate delay in lodging the complaint. The medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The victim has been tutored by her parents to give false evidence against the accused, which is evident from her cross-examination. He submits that the trial Court has erred in observing that the contradictions in a child's testimony should not be given the same effect as in the testimony of an adult by ignoring the admission given by the victim that she was tutored by her mother to give evidence as deposed by her. He submits that the evidence of the victim girl clearly shows that she was acting under the influence of her parents and therefore, she is a tutored witness. Hence, it is not safe to act upon such evidence particularly when the medical evidence does not corroborate with the evidence of the victim. He therefore submits that the impugned Judgment and Order of conviction and sentence passed by the trial Court be set aside and the appeal be allowed. ..

[case 54]
Madhya Pradesh High Court Manju Shrivastava vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 January, 2025. This revision under Section 438 read with Section 442 of the BNSS has been preferred by the petitioner being aggrieved by the order dated 02. 06. 2024 passed by the trial Court whereby her application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. has been rejected. As per the prosecution, on 18. 02. 2019 a complaint was lodged by the petitioner to the effect that she is residing at her house along with her husband and son and his three children. On 09. 02. 2019 her son had come home and had fallen ill. She had called her daughter and son-in-law to her home for his treatment. On seeing them his son beat them and abused her. He also beat his children and stated that he shall take them with him to Banglore and if he is stopped he shall kill them. On the basis of the complaint lodged by the petitioner investigation was commenced during the course of which statements of children of the accused were recorded in which they stated that their father has been responsible for the death of their mother and he had not given her proper treatment. After that he has been touching them with a bad touch and has been committing various heinous acts with them. He used to get females from his office at home. He always used to drink and make them sleep with him in the bed. Various other allegations as regards unnatural sexual advances were made. On the basis of the complaint and the investigation FIR was registered against the accused and the matter was proceeded with. After completion of the investigation charge-sheet has been filed before the Court concerned. During proceedings before the trial Court the petitioner filed an application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. for impleading one Sanjeev Ameen also as an accused in the case. It was submitted that in the statements of the minor children (victims) recorded by the Child Welfare Committee, Indore name of Sanjeev Ameen had been clearly revealed. In their statement under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. also and in evidence before the trial Court his name has been specifically mentioned by the victims. The application was contested by the accused and has been rejected by the trial Court by the impugned order primarily on the ground that in the complaint and her statement the petitioner had not stated anything against Sanjeev Ameen. The victims had also not made any such statement. Earlier a complaint was preferred by the petitioner against Sanjeev Ameen which was dismissed with liberty that in case it is found during investigation that he has committed any offence he may be impleaded as an accused or the petitioner may file a separate complaint. Thereafter charge-sheet has been filed before the Court in which he has not been made an accused. The application has been preferred belatedly. As per Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. it is not only during course of inquiry but also during course of trial that a person may be impleaded as an accused and be proceeded with if it appears that he has committed any offence for which he could be tried together with the already impleaded accused. The trial Court has relied upon the proceedings prior to filing of the chargesheet and during investigation which were not relevant. If earlier a complaint had been filed by the petitioner which had been dismissed with observations and liberty, that did not preclude the power of the Court to array any person as an accused if during trial it appeared that he had committed any offence. The liberty granted to the petitioner earlier would not arrest the power of the Court so also the reason that the investigating agency has not chosen to implead Sanjeev Ameen as an accused. The impleadment can be done during course of trial hence the ground of delay in rejecting the application does not hold good. It is not to be seen as to whether the person sought to be made an accused has not been named initially but it has to be seen as to whether there is any material showing his involvement at any stage. Reliance by the trial Court on the initial complaint made by the petitioner, application made by her to the Police Station and the omission of the victims to name Sanjeev Ameen in their statements under Section 161 of the Cr. P. C. were hence wholly irrelevant. In the statement given by them under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. they had specifically named him. In the letter dated 06. 03. 2019 written by Child Welfare Committee also the allegations as leveled by the victims against Sanjeev Ameen were mentioned. Despite that if the prosecution has not arrayed him as an accused it did not denude the trial Court of its power for directing his impleadment as an accused. In his statement recorded before the trial Court as PW-1, the victim No. 1, who is son of the present accused, has clearly stated that the accused used to come drunk at night and used to beat him and her sisters and used to do dirty acts with him and her sisters. He clearly stated that along with him his friend Sanjeev Ameen also used to come home and used to touch him in an inappropriate manner and also used to touch his private part. There is hence clear statement by one of the victims as regards the criminal act having been committed by Sanjeev Ameen. This in itself was sufficient for him to be impleaded as an accused. The trial Court in view of the statement ought to have itself made him an accused in the case but it did not do so and when application was preferred by the petitioner for the said purpose has dismissed the same on wholly irrelevant considerations. In view of categoric statement of one of the victims impleadment of Sanjeev Ameen as an accused is legally warranted and imperative in the matter. As a result of the aforesaid discussion, in my opinion, the trial Court has erred in rejecting the application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. preferred by the petitioner. The impugned order dated 02. 06. 2024 passed by it is set aside and the application preferred by the petitioner stands allowed. The trial Court is directed to proceed further in accordance with law. The petition is accordingly allowed and disposed off.

[case 55]
Deepu B @ Kuttan vs State Of Kerala Represented By Public Prosecutor on 21 August, 2020. This Bail Application filed under Section 439 of Criminal Procedure Code was heard through Video Conference. The Petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 263 of 2020 of Hosdurg Police Station, Kasargod District. The above case is registered against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under Section 376AB of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) r/w. Sections 6 r/w 5(m)(n) of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The petitioner is in custody from 20. 6. 2020 onwards. The prosecution case is that, on 1. 4. 2020, the accused sexually abused a minor girl aged 4 ½ years by touching the genital organ of the victim. It is the case of the defacto complainant, the mother of the victim girl that, the child complained about a pain on her private parts and when the defacto complainant enquired about the same, the child disclosed to the defacto complainant that the petitioner committed the above activities. The alleged incident happened on 1. 4. 2020. The F. I. statement was given on 12. 5. 2020. The petitioner was arrested on 20. 6. 2020. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned public prosecutor. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that, the petitioner is innocent in this case. The counsel submitted that, this is a false case foisted against the petitioner by the mother of the victim. The counsel submitted that, there is some difference of opinion between the defacto complainant and her husband. The petitioner is a close relative of the husband of the defacto complainant. The counsel submitted that, the petitioner supported the husband of the defacto complainant when there was a dispute between the defacto complainant and her husband. According to the petitioner, at that time, the defacto complainant threatened that, she will foist a false case against the petitioner. The counsel submitted that, the husband of the defacto complainant filed an affidavit before this Court. The counsel submitted that, in the affidavit, it is stated by the father of the victim, who is the husband of the defacto complainant that, this is a false case foisted against the petitioner. The father of the victim clearly stated that the petitioner is innocent in this case. The learned public prosecutor seriously opposed this bail application. The public prosecutor submitted that the allegations against the petitioner are very serious. The allegation is that, the petitioner committed sexual assault on a minor girl aged 4 ½ years. The public prosecutor submitted that the petitioner is not entitled orders under Section 439 Cr. P. C. at this stage. After hearing both sides, I think, this bail application can be allowed, on stringent conditions. Admittedly, the petitioner is in custody from 20. 6. 2020 onwards. The alleged incident happened on 1. 4. 2020 and the F. I. statement was given only on 12. 5. 2020. Admittedly, there is some matrimonial dispute between the defact complainant and her husband. It is also an admitted fact that, the petitioner is a close relative of the husband of the defact complainant. It is true that, an affidavit is filed by the father of the victim girl exonerating the petitioner from the allegation. I do not want to make any observation about the contents in the affidavit at this stage. This is a matter to be investigated by the investigating officer. Considering the entire facts and circumstances of this case, I think, this bail application can be allowed on stringent conditions. There can be a direction to the petitioner not to enter the jurisdictional limit of Hosdurg Police Station till a final report in Crime No. 263 of 2020 of Hosdurg Police Station, is filed. Moreover, considering the need to follow social distancing norms inside prisons so as to avert the spread of the novel Corona Virus Pandemic, the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Re: Contagion of COVID-19 Virus In Prisons case (Suo Motu Writ Petition(C) No. 1 of 2020) and a Full Bench of this Court in W. P(C)No. 9400 of 2020 issued various salutary directions for minimizing the number of inmates inside prisons. Moreover, it is a well accepted principle that, the bail is the rule and the jail is the exception. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chidambaram P. v. Directorate of Enforcement observed that, the basic jurisprudence relating to bail remains the same inasmuch as the grant of bail is the rule and refusal is the exception so as to ensure that the accused has the opportunity of securing fair trial. Considering the dictum laid down in the above decision and considering the facts and circumstances of this case, this Bail Application is allowed with the following directions: 1. The petitioner shall be released on bail on executing a bond for Rs. 50, 000/- (Rupees Fifty Thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Court; 2. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer for interrogation as and when required. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation and shall not, directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or promise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from disclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer; 3. The petitioner shall not leave India without permission of the jurisdictional Court; 4. The petitioner shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is accused, or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected; 5. The petitioner shall not enter the jurisdictional limit of Hosdurg Police Station, except for the purposes mentioned above, till a final report in Crime No. 263 of 2020 of Hosdurge Police Station is filed. 6. The petitioner shall strictly abide by the various guidelines issued by the State Government and Central Government with respect to keeping of social distancing in the wake of Covid 19 pandemic; 7. If any of the above conditions are violated by the petitioner, the jurisdictional Court can cancel the bail in accordance to law, even though the bail is granted by this Court. Sd/- P. V.

It is also pointed out that there is no consistent evidence relating to the date of the alleged incident. In addition to the aforesaid aspects, it is also pointed out that the applicant/accused is a 75 year old man suffering from Hydrocele and Bradycardia and that he requires surgery. Earlier, he was granted interim bail for a period of one month for the purpose of undergoing surgery. However, as his blood pressure could not be brought under control, the surgery could not take place and hence on medical grounds also the suspension is sought for. The learned public prosecutor opposes the application and submits that the victim child, who was only 10 years old, has clearly deposed before the court that she was unable to recall the date on which the incidents of abuse took place. However, she has clearly deposed that on three different occasions, the accused herein had committed digital rape on her. This probably must be the reason why she was unable to recollect the exact dates on which the incident took place. The learned public prosecutor also draws my attention to the testimony of PW4, a consultant pediatrician, Sun Hospital, Thrissur, to substantiate the argument that the medical evidence is also there to support the prosecution story. Heard both sides. I was taken through Ext. P1 FIS as well as the testimony of PW2, the victim; PW1, the mother and PW9, the doctor who examined the victim child on 24/11/2016. Ext. P1 FIS is seen given by the mother on 24/11/2016. In the FIS, the allegation is that the incident of abuse took place on 22/11/2016. According to the testimony of PW1, the mother, the incident took place on 24/11/2016 and it was on the same day she had taken PW2 to the hospital as she had seen injuries on the private parts as well as a hair inside the mouth of PW2. However PW9, the doctor who examined the child on 24/11/2016 in Ext. P6 medical certificate records that there was no external injury. As far as the testimony of PW4 is concerned, it is seen that there are absolutely no records to support his testimony that he had examined the child sometime in November 2016. It is also brought to my notice that the victim child had stated in her 161 statement that the incident took place on 23/11/2016 whereas in her chief examination, her testimony was that the incident took place on 22/11/2016. This contradiction was brought out in her examination and proved through the testimony of PW6 and the same has been marked as Ext. D2. On going through the testimony of the material prosecution witnesses, I think that the learned counsel for the applicant/accused is justified in arguing that there are inconsistencies in the testimonies and that doubts arise from the materials on record. It appears that the applicant/accused has got a good arguable case and therefore in the aforesaid circumstances and on medical ground, the sentence of the applicant/accused is suspended till the disposal of the appeal. It is submitted that the fine amount has already been deposited before the trial court. Hence, the sentence imposed on the applicant/accused is suspended on the following conditions: i) The applicant/accused shall be released on bail on executing a bond for ₹50, 000/- (Rupees fifty thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial court; ii) He shall not in any way contact or attempt to contact the victim or family member(s) in any manner; iii) He shall not commit any offence(s) while on bail; iv) If the conviction and sentence of the applicant is upheld or even modified, the time during which he is so released shall be excluded in computing the term of his sentence as provided in Section 430(4) BNSS; v) It is also made clear that if any of the conditions are violated, the bail shall stand cancelled.

[case 57]
Madhya Pradesh High Court Manju Shrivastava vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 16 January, 2025. This revision under Section 438 read with Section 442 of the BNSS has been preferred by the petitioner being aggrieved by the order dated 02. 06. 2024 passed by the trial Court whereby her application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. has been rejected. As per the prosecution, on 18. 02. 2019 a complaint was lodged by the petitioner to the effect that she is residing at her house along with her husband and son and his three children. On 09. 02. 2019 her son had come home and had fallen ill. She had called her daughter and son-in-law to her home for his treatment. On seeing them his son beat them and abused her. He also beat his children and stated that he shall take them with him to Banglore and if he is stopped he shall kill them. On the basis of the complaint lodged by the petitioner investigation was commenced during the course of which statements of children of the accused were recorded in which they stated that their father has been responsible for the death of their mother and he had not given her proper treatment. After that he has been touching them with a bad touch and has been committing various heinous acts with them. He used to get females from his office at home. He always used to drink and make them sleep with him in the bed. Various other allegations as regards unnatural sexual advances were made. On the basis of the complaint and the investigation FIR was registered against the accused and the matter was proceeded with. During proceedings before the trial Court the petitioner filed an application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. for impleading one Sanjeev Ameen also as an accused in the case. It was submitted that in the statements of the minor children (victims) recorded by the Child Welfare Committee, Indore name of Sanjeev Ameen had been clearly revealed. In their statement under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. also and in evidence before the trial Court his name has been specifically mentioned by the victims. The application was contested by the accused and has been rejected by the trial Court by the impugned order primarily on the ground that in the complaint and her statement the petitioner had not stated anything against Sanjeev Ameen. The victims had also not made any such statement. Earlier a complaint was preferred by the petitioner against Sanjeev Ameen which was dismissed with liberty that in case it is found during investigation that he has committed any offence he may be impleaded as an accused or the petitioner may file a separate complaint. Thereafter charge-sheet has been filed before the Court in which he has not been made an accused. The application has been preferred belatedly. As per Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. it is not only during course of inquiry but also during course of trial that a person may be impleaded as an accused and be proceeded with if it appears that he has committed any offence for which he could be tried together with the already impleaded accused. The trial Court has relied upon the proceedings prior to filing of the chargesheet and during investigation which were not relevant. If earlier a complaint had been filed by the petitioner which had been dismissed with observations and liberty, that did not preclude the power of the Court to array any person as an accused if during trial it appeared that he had committed any offence. The liberty granted to the petitioner earlier would not arrest the power of the Court so also the reason that the investigating agency has not chosen to implead Sanjeev Ameen as an accused. The impleadment can be done during course of trial hence the ground of delay in rejecting the application does not hold good. It is not to be seen as to whether the person sought to be made an accused has not been named initially but it has to be seen as to whether there is any material showing his involvement at any stage. Reliance by the trial Court on the initial complaint made by the petitioner, application made by her to the Police Station and the omission of the victims to name Sanjeev Ameen in their statements under Section 161 of the Cr. P. C. were hence wholly irrelevant. In the statement given by them under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. they had specifically named him. In the letter dated 06. 03. 2019 written by Child Welfare Committee also the allegations as leveled by the victims against Sanjeev Ameen were mentioned. Despite that if the prosecution has not arrayed him as an accused it did not denude the trial Court of its power for directing his impleadment as an accused. In his statement recorded before the trial Court as PW-1, the victim No. 1, who is son of the present accused, has clearly stated that the accused used to come drunk at night and used to beat him and her sisters and used to do dirty acts with him and her sisters. He clearly stated that along with him his friend Sanjeev Ameen also used to come home and used to touch him in an inappropriate manner and also used to touch his private part. There is hence clear statement by one of the victims as regards the criminal act having been committed by Sanjeev Ameen. This in itself was sufficient for him to be impleaded as an accused. The trial Court in view of the statement ought to have itself made him an accused in the case but it did not do so and when application was preferred by the petitioner for the said purpose has dismissed the same on wholly irrelevant considerations. In view of categoric statement of one of the victims impleadment of Sanjeev Ameen as an accused is legally warranted and imperative in the matter. As a result of the aforesaid discussion, in my opinion, the trial Court has erred in rejecting the application under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. preferred by the petitioner. The impugned order dated 02. 06. 2024 passed by it is set aside and the application preferred by the petitioner stands allowed. The trial Court is directed to proceed further in accordance with law. The petition is accordingly allowed and disposed off.

This petition under Section 439(2) of Cr. P. C. , is filed by the de facto complainant with the prayer to cancel the anticipatory bail granted to accused Nos. 2 and 3 in Crime No. 177/2024, registered by Indi Rural Police Station for the offenses punishable under Sections 85, 103(1), 80 read with Section 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Act, 2023 and Sections 3 and 4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 by the Court of II Additional District and Session Judge, Vijayapura in Criminal Misc. No. 1421/2024. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the parties. 3. FIR in Crime No. 177/2024, was registered by Indi Rural Police Station, Vijayapura, for the offenses punishable under Sections 85, 103(1), 80, read with Section 3(5) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita Act, 2023 on the basis of the first information dated 31. 07. 2024 received by Smt. Gumabai, mother of deceased Reshma as against Vikram and the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein who are the parents of accused No. 1 Vikram. Apprehending their arrest in said case, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein had filed Criminal Misc. No. 1421/2024 before the II Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vijayapura, which was allowed on 08. 10. 2024 and the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein were granted anticipatory bail subject to certain conditions. Investigation of the case is completed and the charge sheet has been filed. Being aggrieved by the anticipatory bail granted to accused Nos. 2 and 3, the de facto complainant is before this Court 4. Perusal of the averments made in the first information dated 31. 07. 2024 would reveal that, the marriage of accused No. 1 who is the son of the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein, with the daughter of the first informant was performed in the year 2021 and from the said wedlock the couple had a child. On 30. 07. 2024, the accused No. 1 had informed the first informant that, Reshma had suffered low blood pressure and had died. On 31. 07. 2024 the first informant and her family members had gone to the house of accused No. 1 and had found the dead body of their daughter Reshma inside the compound wall of a school near Aluru Tanda, within the jurisdiction of Indi Rural Police Station. Since the first informant suspected with regard to the cause of death of her daughter, she had approached the police and had submitted first information, based on which an FIR was registered against Vikram and the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 herein. The police after investigation have filed charge-sheet against three persons. Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have been arraigned as accused Nos. 2 and 3 in the charge-sheet. As per the charge-sheet allegations, on 30. 07. 2024, at about 7: 30 pm, when accused No. 1 and his wife Reshma were traveling in a car along with their child aged about six months, they had fought against each other and accused No. 1 - Vikram had made a demand with his wife to bring a sum of Rs. 5, 00, 000/- from her parents house. When the car in which accused No. 1 and his wife were traveling reached near Indi railway station, all of a sudden accused No. 1 got down from the car and after abusing his wife, with the help of a plastic cover which was in the hind seat of the car, he had strangulated the neck of his wife and had committed her murder. Thereafter, he drove the car to his parents' house and informed them that his wife had died as a result of low blood pressure and as per the advice of his parents he had left the dead body inside the compound wall of the school. Except this, there is no other allegation as against the parents of accused No. 1 who are respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in the present petition. Accused No. 2 is a teacher in a Government School and accused No. 3 who is his wife is a House maker. The learned Session Judge having appreciated all these aspects of the matter, has granted anticipatory bail to them and in compliance of the bail conditions they had appeared before the Investigating Officer and have co-operated with him for the purpose of investigation. 5. Under the circumstances, I do not find any good ground to interfere with the order of anticipatory bail granted to accused Nos. 2 and 3 in the present case. Accordingly, the following order: ORDER The criminal petition is dismissed. Sd/- (S. VISHWAJITH SHETTY) JUDGE SVH List No. : 1 Sl No. : 9 CT: PK

C. for cross-examination of PW2, PW8 and PW9 and direct the Mahila Judge, Chennai permitting the petitioner to cross-examine PW2, PW8 and PW9. For Petitioner: Mr. B. Janakiram For Respondent: Ms. P. Kritika Kamal, GA [Crl. Side] O R D E R This Criminal Original Petition has been filed praying to set aside the order dated 21. 05. 2018, passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai in Crl. M. P. No. 7906 of 2016 in S. C. No. 226 of 2016. 2. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Advocate [Crl. Side] appearing for the respondent. 3. On the complaint lodged by Regina Mary that her six year old daughter[x] was sexually abused by the petitioner herein, the respondent Police registered a case in Crime No. 9 of 2015 and after completing the investigation, have filed a final report and trial in S. C. No. 226 of 2016 is pending on the file of the Mahila Court, Chennai for various offences under POCSO Act. Charges were framed against the petitioner/accused and the prosecution witnesses were examined. The victim girl-x was examined as PW2 on 09. 02. 2017. She was not cross-examined by the accused. The prosecution examined 11 witnesses, who were not cross-examined by the accused. After 1= years, the accused filed Crl. M. P. No. 7906 of 2018 in S. C. No. 226 of 2016 under Section 311 Cr. P. C. to recall PW1 to PW11, which has been partly allowed by the trial Court. Challenging which, the accused is before this Court. 4. On a reading of the impugned order, it is seen that the trial Court has refused permission to recall the victim girl-x [PW2]. But, whereas, the trial Court has ordered the recall of PW1, PW3 to PW7, PW10 and PW11. 5. Learned counsel for the accused submitted that a false case has been foisted on the accused and therefore, it is necessary for the accused to recall the victim girl-x and the two Doctors, namely, PW8 and PW9, who have examined the victim girl and the accused. He placed strong reliance on the judgment of the Supreme Court in Mannan SK and Others Vs State of West Bengal and Another, wherein, the Supreme Court has held as follows: The second part of the Section uses the word 'shall'. It says that the court shall summon and examine or recall or re-examine any such person if his evidence appears to it to be essential to the just decision of the case. The words 'essential to the just decision of the case' are the key words. The court must form an opinion that for the just decision of the case recall or re-examination of the witness is necessary. Since the power is wide it's exercise has to be done with circumspection. It is trite that wider the power greater is the responsibility on the courts which exercise it. .. . 6. This Court gave its anxious consideration to the rival submissions. It is true that power under Section 311 Cr. P. C. can be invoked at any time before the judgment is delivered, if it is found that the evidence of a particular witness is just and essential. In this case, the victim girl was examined on 09. 02. 2017. She was not cross-examined by the counsel. 7. Learned counsel for the accused submitted that the earlier counsel had bungled and therefore, on change of counsel, an opportunity should be given to recall the victim girl. Section 33[5] of the POCSO Act states that a child witness should not be called repeatedly to the Court for the purpose of examination. The idea behind this provision is that a child will suffer psychological trauma, if she is made to repeat the ordeal that was undergone by her. In this case, the victim is a nine year old girl. Proviso to Section 309 Cr. P. C. reads as follows: [b] the fact that the Pleader of a party is engaged in any other Court, shall not be a ground for adjournment. Thus, the statute says that just because the pleader of a party is engaged in another Court, that cannot be a ground for adjournment. It will be a travesty of justice to overlook Section 309 Cr. P. C. and Section 33[5] of POCSO Act and say that on account of change of counsel, the victim girl should be recalled. 8. As regards PW8 and PW9, they are Government Doctors, whose time is indeed precious. In Vinodh Kumar Vs State of Punjab reported in 2015[1] MLJ [Crl] 288, the Supreme Court has taken note of the pernicious practice that is prevailing in the trial Courts today, whereby no witness is cross-examined on the day they are examined in-chief, they recalled after several days and in the meantime, they are either intimidated or won over. 9. In Mannan S. K. case relied upon by the learned counsel for the accused, the prosecution wanted to recall the Investigating Officer, who had recorded the statement of the deceased at the scene of the offence. Since the statement of the deceased is relevant as dying declaration under Section 32 of the Evidence Act, the Supreme Court thought it fit, not to shut out such a valuable piece of evidence. 10. In A. G. Vs Shiv Kumar Yadav reported in 2015[9] Scale 649, the Supreme Court has stated that a petition under Section 311 Cr. P. C. cannot be allowed, on the mere asking even if the accused is in judicial custody. The reasons given by the accused to recall PW2, PW8 and PW9 does not pass muster, the law laid down by the Supreme Court in Vinodh Kumar's case and A. G. Vs Shiv Kumar Yadav's case. Under such circumstances, this Court does not find any infirmity in the order passed by the trial Court warranting interference and this petition stands dismissed. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.

Punjab-Haryana High Court
Rakesh Kumar vs State Of Haryana on 5 September, 2018
Author: H. S. Madaan
Bench: H. S. Madaan
CRM-M-34093-2018 -1-
IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT
CRM-M-34093-2018
Date of decision: -5. 9. 2018
State of Haryana
CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H. S. MADAAN
Present: Mr. Karan Singh, Advocate
for the petitioner.
Mr. Gaurav Bansal, AAG, Haryana.
Mr. G. C. Shahpuri, Advocate
for the complainant.
H. S. MADAAN, J.
This petition under Section 438 Cr. P. C. for pre-arrest bail has
been filed by the petitioner - Rakesh Kumar, an accused in FIR No. 30
dated 6. 7. 2018 under Section 8 of POCSO Act and 216 IPC, registered at
Women Police Station, Yamuna Nagar.
Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution
story, are that on 29. 12. 2017 when the prosecutrix aged about 16 years
had gone to her BARA from her house at village Dhaurang, District
Yamuna Nagar, then Rakesh son of Subhash (present petitioner) resident
of that very village misbehaved with her catching hold of arm of
prosecutrix. The prosecutrix narrated the entire story to her parents, then
police was informed by moving a written application at Women Police
Station, Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri.
Apprehending his arrest in this case, the petitioner had
approached the Court of Sessions seeking grant of pre-arrest bail by filing
an application, however, his such request was declined by learned
Additional Sessions Judge (Exclusive Court for Heinous Crimes against
Women and Children), Yamuna Nagar at Jagadhri vide order dated
2. 8. 2018. As such, the petitioner has approached this Court asking for
the same relief.
Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State, which
put in appearance through counsel. The complainant has also appeared
through counsel.
I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going
through the record and I do not find any merit in the present petition.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that as a matter
of fact on 29. 12. 2017, the complainant Subhash Chand and his family
members had attacked family of petitioner causing injuries to them and on
that very day, Smt. Parveena wife of Mahinder Kumar had submitted a
complaint to SHO, Police Station Sadar, Yamuna Nagar regarding the
incident on which DDR No. 7 dated 30. 12. 2017 was entered in daily diary
and the present FIR is just a counter-blast to the complaint dated
29. 12. 2017 against family members of the complainant.
Whereas, learned State counsel and learned counsel for the
complainant submitted that the incident as per FIR in this case took place
on 29. 12. 2017. Admittedly, no action has been taken on the alleged
complaint submitted by Smt. Parveena regarding Subhash Chand and his
family allegedly attacking family of the petitioner and causing injuries to
them. If the police had found merit in the allegations observing that
commission of cognizable offence was disclosed, then FIR would have
normally been registered, which was not so done, rather it appears that the
DDR in question was lodged to create defence in the present FIR as a
pressure tactic and to set up a parallel case.
After hearing the rival contentions of learned counsel for the
parties, I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young
girls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture
out of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is
fast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial
stage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to
control. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls
need to be dealt with iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them.
Here the allegations against the petitioner are quite serious and grave. Pre
arrest bail is a discretionary relief and is to be granted in exceptional cases
and not in routine. It is meant to save the innocent persons from
harassment and inconvenience and not to screen the culprits from
custodial interrogation.
Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is definitely required
for complete and effective investigation. In case custodial interrogation of
the petitioner is denied to the investigating agency that would leave many
loose ends and gaps in the investigation affecting the investigation being
carried out adversely which is not called for.
Thus finding no merit in the petition, the same stands

[case 61]
Mohd. Aleem, vs The State Oftelangana, on 13 September, 2022. The petitioners claim to be the joint owners of Plot No. 64, admeasuring 267 sq. yards situated in Sy. No. 844/16 forming part of Annapurna Cooperative Housing Society Limited, Malkajgiri, Ranga Reddy District, having purchased the same under registered sale deed dated 29. 09. 2010. Subsequently the petitioners constructed Ground plus Three floors (G+3) by obtaining permission from GHMC and the property was assessed with H. No. 17-119/A64. The petitioners had been staying in the ground floor of the said building. The petitioners gave first, second and third floor of the building to M/s. Save a Child, a private organization, represented by Sri M. Sunit Kumar, S/o. Christopher, under rental agreement dated 03. 07. 2014 for a period of 11 months. The lease was extended from time to time. While so, the respondent No. 2 addressed a communication dated 22. 06. 2017, along with a copy of a note approved by the Collector, Medchal-Malkajgiri District, stating that sexual abuse has happened on an inmate of 'Save a Child' orphanage by the founder M. Sunit Kumar and in that connection, the District Collector has given instructions to close and seize the movable and immovable property and bank accounts of the orphanage located in the premises of the petitioners. On the instructions of the District Collector, the respondent No. 4 directed the Village Revenue Officer, Malkajgiri, to seize the orphanage, which was being run in the first, second and third floors of the building of the petitioners. Accordingly, three floors were seized on 24. 06. 2017 under cover of panchanma. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the 'Save a Child' orphanage is the tenant of the petitioners. In the process of taking action against the founder of the orphanage, the property of the petitioners could not have been seized. A request was made by the petitioners vide representation dated 08. 10. 2017 to the respondent No. 3 for releasing the seized property. The petitioners have given the property on lease to the orphanage for a monthly rent of Rs. 41, 000/-. The petitioner is put to loss since July 2017. There are several maintenance issues in the property. Learned Assistant Government Pleader for Women Development and Child Welfare Department submitted that the orphanage was seized for violation of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and the National Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016. The petitioners should have checked the registration certificate of the orphanage before giving the property on rent or lease. The petitioners allowed the founder of the orphanage to run a home for children in need of care and protection illegally. The orphanage management did not submit original copies of the rental agreement at the time of inspection. The petitioner did not register the lease deed of the building at the concerned Sub-Registrar. FIR No. 446 of 2017 was registered against Sunith Kumar, in-charge of the orphanage, under Section 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and under Section 376-C and 506 IPC with L. B. Nagar Police Station. The seized movable and immovable property of the orphanage was kept in the building of the petitioners. As per the orders of the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L. B. Nagar, action will be taken on the movable and immovable properties. Learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the petitioners are not the accused in FIR. No. 446 of 2017. The petitioners are only the owners of the subject premises and the seizure is illegal. As such, there is no requirement for the petitioners to approach the concerned Court for release of the premises/property. It is not in dispute that the petitioners are the owners of the property and the orphanage is the tenant. The contention of the learned Assistant Government Pleader that the petitioners should have registered the lease deed and should have checked the antecedents of the orphanage before giving the property on lease is without any merit. The petitioners, being landlords, would only enquire whether the tenant has the capacity to pay the rents and also ensure that illegal activities are not carried out in the tenanted premises. The misuse of the tenanted property by the tenant and that too after the property was taken on lease cannot in any manner be attributed to the petitioners. The petitioners are not involved in the criminal case, so also the petitioners do not have any civil liability for the illegal activities committed by their tenant and as such, the seizure of the premises is ex facie illegal. However, as the property is stated to have been seized pursuant to registration of FIR. No. 446 of 2017, it would be appropriate to dispose of the writ petition with the following directions: 1. The petitioners shall submit an application to the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L. B. Nagar, seeking release of the subject premises, seized by the Village Revenue Officer, on the directions of the respondent No. 4 on 24. 06. 2017 under the cover of panchanama. 2. The application filed by the petitioners shall be considered and appropriate orders shall be passed forthwith by the I Additional cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L. B. Nagar, releasing the subject premises of the petitioners by imposing reasonable conditions. 3. The documents, movable properties, articles etc. of the orphanage viz. Save a Child, shall be forthwith shifted by concerned police with due intimation to the I Additional District Judge cum Metropolitan Sessions Judge, L. B. Nagar and the same shall be kept in the custody of the police station or the Court or any other safe place in accordance with law. If necessary, permission of the Court shall be taken by the police for shifting the documents, movable properties, articles etc. The miscellaneous petitions pending, if any, shall stand closed. There shall be no order as to costs.

CRR No. 2085 of 2016 (O&M) Date of Decision: July 17, 2018 Dharambir. .. Petitioner Versus State of Haryana and another. .. Respondents CORAM: - HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE JAISHREE THAKUR Present: - Mr. S. S. Momi, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. P. P. Chahar, DAG Haryana. Mr. J. S. Mehndiratta, Advocate for respondents No. 2 and 3. This is a criminal revision filed against the order dated 13. 05. 2016 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Sonepat, where the application filed by the petitioner-complainant under Section 216 of Code of Criminal Procedure for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of Indian Penal Code instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, has been dismissed. In short, the facts of the case are that FIR No. 452 dated 05. 09. 2015 came to be registered under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC at Police Station Sadar, Sonipat against respondents No. 2 and 3 herein on the complaint of petitioner-complainant that on 05. 09. 2015 at around 05. 00 his daughter Deepika committed suicide due to threatening given by Hanni and his mother Suman (respondents No. 2 and 3 herein). It was also alleged that when his daughter went to South Point School tour to Delhi, accused Hanni also reached there and did obscene act with his daughter. When his daughter Deepika returned back, she disclosed this incident to her mother, on which they narrated this matter to Hanni's family, but instead of rebuking her son, Hanni's mother insulted Deepika. Hanni's mother also went to South Point School and insulted his daughter Deepika. Deepika was very upset with the behaviour of Hanni and his mother Suman, compelling her to the extreme step of committing suicide. During the course of investigation, a suicide note was recovered from the lower/trouser worn by the deceased at the time of her death, which was sent to FSL for verification of handwriting of the deceased and as per the report of Forensic Science Laboratory, the handwriting on the suicide note is of the deceased. After completing the investigation, final report under Section 173 Cr. P. C. was filed in the court against respondents No. 2 and 3 under Sections 306/34 of IPC and thereafter, the trial court framed the charges under Sections 306/34 of IPC by an order dated 11. 12. 2015. Thereafter, the petitioner-complainant moved an application under Section 216 Cr. P. C. for amendment of charge on the ground that since the deceased in the instant case was less than 18 years of age, she was a child, and therefore, charge under Section 305 of IPC is required to be framed instead of Section 306 of IPC, but the said application came to be dismissed on 27. 01. 2016. Thereafter, a supplementary challan was filed by the police under Section 173(8) of the Cr. P. C containing documents, birth certificate of Deepika (deceased) and statement of her mother Ishwanti. After that, the petitioner-complainant filed another application under Section 216 of Cr. P. C. for amendment in the charges, by way of framing the charge under Section 305 of IPC instead of 306 of IPC and for further framing the charge under Section 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of the POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC against the accused persons, which application came to be dismissed by the impugned order dated 13. 05. 2016. Mr. S. S. Momi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner argues that it is an admitted fact on the case file the date of birth of deceased Deepika was 09. 11. 2000 and on the date of the occurrence, the deceased was minor, aged about 14 years, at the time when she committed suicide. The age of the deceased is mentioned as 14 years on the postmortem report. It is contended that as per the suicide note, the accused committed 'jabardasti' with the deceased. Meaning thereby, the deceased was molested and sexually abused and as such, charges under Sections 305, 376 of IPC and Sections 6, 8, 12 of POCSO Act read with Section 120-B of IPC are made out against the accused. Mr. J. S. Mehndiratta, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents No. 2 and 3 argues that there is nothing on record to amend the charges already framed. It is submitted that the earlier application filed by the learned Public Prosecutor under Section 216 of Cr. P. C. for amendment of charge has already been dismissed by the trial court and the suicide note was already on the file at the time of framing of charges in the present case. I have heard learned counsel for the parties, apart from perusing the record. On the basis of the complaint filed by the petitioner-complainant and the investigation done by the police, final report under Section 173 Cr. P. C. was filed under Section 306 read with Section 34 of IPC. The earlier application moved under Section 216 Cr. P. C. came to be dismissed on 27. 01. 2016 by the trial court, while observing that there is no material pertaining to date of birth of the deceased in the form of birth certificate or in the statement of her father has been found. Thereafter, a supplementary challan came to be filed under Section 173(8) Cr. P. C. containing the date of birth certificate of the deceased. However, the trial court has not said anything about the date of birth certificate of the deceased. The trial court further observed the suicide note prima facie makes out an offence under Section 306 of IPC, although the trial court did not consider the date of birth certificate of the deceased, submitted in the form of supplementary statement. Under these peculiar facts and circumstances, prima facie, at this stage, a case under Section 305 read with Section 34 of IPC is made out against the accused persons and the charge is required to be altered accordingly. In view of the above, the criminal revision in hand is partly allowed and the impugned order passed by the trial court is set aside to the above extent only.

[case 64]
2. Heard Sri Rajiv Kumar Tripathi, learned counsel for the applicant as well as Sri Sunil Kumar, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the record.
3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 39 of 2024, under Sections 498-A, 304-B, 323, 504, 506 I. P. C. and 3/4 D. P. Act, Police Station- Kailiya, District- Jalaun, during the pendency of trial.
PROSECUTION STORY:
4. The marriage of the applicant was solemnized with the daughter of the informant as per Hindu Rites on 12. 5. 2018. The applicant and other family members are stated to have subjected her to cruelty for demand of a motorcycle as dowry, thereby, leading her to death on 26. 6. 2024.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF APPLICANT:
5. The applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case.
6. The FIR is delayed by about one day and there is no explanation of the said delay caused. No time of offence is mentioned in the FIR.
7. The informant herein is Panch witness no. 1 in the inquest proceedings, which was undertaken on the information given by the brother of the applicant to the police. The inquest report was already complete on 26. 6. 2024 at 08: 45 p. m.
8. The victim was depressed as she could not bear any child and the applicant had dark complexion.
9. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length.
10. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 6. 7. 2024 and is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail.
ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF STATE/OPPOSITE PARTY:
11. The bail application has been opposed but the submissions raised by the learned counsel for the applicant could not be disputed.
12. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
13. The well-known principle of "Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty" gives rise to the concept of bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.
14. A person's right to life and liberty, guaranteed by Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, cannot be taken away simply because the person is accused of committing an offence until the guilt is established beyond a reasonable doubt. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that no one's life or personal liberty may be taken away unless the procedure established by law is followed, and the procedure must be just and reasonable. The said principle has been recapitulated by the Supreme Court in Satender Kumar Antil Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. , 2022 INSC 690.
15. Reiterating the aforesaid view the Supreme Court in the case of Manish Sisodia Vs. Directorate of Enforcement 2024 INSC 595 has again emphasised that the very well-settled principle of law that bail is not to be withheld as a punishment is not to be forgotten. It is high time that the Courts should recognize the principle that bail is a rule and jail is an exception? .
16. Learned AGA could not bring forth any exceptional circumstances which would warrant denial of bail to the applicant.
17. It is settled principle of law that the object of bail is to secure the attendance of the accused at the trial. No material particulars or circumstances suggestive of the applicant fleeing from justice or thwarting the course of justice or creating other troubles in the shape of repeating offences or intimidating witnesses and the like have been shown by learned AGA.
18. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed.
19. Let the applicant- Dilip involved in aforementioned case crime number be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions.
(i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence.
(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr. P. C. /351 B. N. S. S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
20. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. Identity, status and residence proof of the applicant and sureties be verified by the court concerned before the bonds are accepted.
21. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

Cis­Sc No. 7095/16 State vs. Fareem Beg Page 1 Of 6 on 30 May, 2017. IN THE COURT OF SHRI BALWANT RAI BANSAL ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­1 (SOUTH), NEW DELHI. CIS ­ Sessions Case No. 7095/16 FIR No. 391/15 Police Station: Mehrauli In the matter of: State VERSUS Fareem Beg S/o Sh. Mahboob Beg Present Address: ­ Coconut Shop situated at CNG Pump, Dera Road, Rajpur Khurd, Delhi Permanent Address: ­ V. P. O. Mavai Kajiyan Tehsil Baheri, PS Sher Garh, District Bareilly, U. P. Date of Institution: 11. 12. 2015 Date of Reserving judgment: Not reserved Date of pronouncement: 30. 05. 2017 JUDGMENT 1. In the present case, accused Fareem Beg S/o Mahboob Beg has been charged and facing trial for the commission of offences punishable under section 354 of Indian Penal Code (in short 'IPC') and section 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (in short 'POCSO Act'), 2012 r/w section 9 of the said Act on the allegations of outraging the modesty of a girl child, namely, V (real name withheld in order to conceal her identity), aged about 8 years and committing aggravated sexual assault upon her. 2. The FIR in question was registered on the complaint of Raju Yadav, the father of the victim girl, who in his complaint has alleged that on 23. 08. 2015 at 6. 00 PM, accused Fareem Beg along with his two associates namely Naim and Sehzad misbehaved with his victim daughter, abused her and gesturing with her and when he objected to the same, he was threatened by accused and his associates. On the said complaint of the father of the victim, the present FIR was registered u/s 506/509 of IPC and section 12 of POCSO Act on 24. 08. 2015 and the investigation was commenced. 3. During course of investigation, counseling of victim girl was conducted by NGO Mehar Charitable Society through DCW and her statement under section 161 of Cr. P. C. was recorded and site plan of place of occurrence was prepared at the instance of complainant Raju Yadav. Statement of the victim under section 164 of Cr. P. C. was also got recorded. During further investigation, date of birth proof of the victim girl was collected and accused Fareem Beg was arrested on 13. 10. 2015 and was sent to judicial custody. However, subsequently he was granted bail by the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated 27. 04. 2016. Another accused Shezad had joined the investigation but no sufficient evidence against him was found and therefore IO kept his name in column No. 12 of the charge­sheet. The co­accused namely Faim @ Naim who is brother of accused Fareem Beg was evading and he is at large. NBWs against him were taken. On the basis of the statement of the victim girl recorded under section 164 of Cr. P. C, section 506/509 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act were added and challan was prepared under sections 354/506/509/34 of IPC and section 8 & 12 of POCSO Act and put up before the court on 11. 12. 2015 for trial against the accused Fareem Beg. 4. On 29. 02. 2016, after hearing the Ld. Defence Counsel for the accused Fareem Beg and the Ld. Special Public Prosecution, Charge for the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and. 5. The victim and the complainant, who is also father of the victim on whose complaint the present FIR got registered against the accused Fareem Beg, are the star and material witnesses of the prosecution, who could have proved the allegations levelled against the accused. But the prosecution has miserably failed to examine both the witnesses despite availing sufficient opportunities. The prosecution even could not trace out the victim and her father and they could not be served despite best efforts made by the prosecution. The victim girl though in her statement recorded u/s 164 Cr. P. C. stated that she was playing at 6'O clock in the evening and at that time Naim, Fareem (accused in the present case) and Shejzaad came there. Naim caught her, Fareem caught and kissed her and put his both the hands in her panty and tried to open her pajama. She shouted loudly then her father came and they all fled away. She further sated that Fareem and Naim came to her father later and threatened him if he would make any complaint in this regard, they would kill her father. But the victim girl did not appear in the witness box to prove all these allegations. In the absence of testimony of victim and her father, no incriminating evidence has come on record against the accused. There is no other eyewitness to the incident. Rest of the witnesses are formal i. e. the counselor who counseled the victim, the principal to prove the age of the victim, DO to prove the registration of FIR, IO and the Ld. MM who recorded the statement of victim u/s 164 Cr. P. C. Hence, it will be a futile exercise to examine rest of the witnesses in this case, as none of them is an eyewitness to the incident. Continuing with this trial any further, will only result in wastage of time and resources, and there will be no impact on the result of this trial. Hence, the prosecution evidence is closed and the SA of the accused is dispensed with. 6. In the overall facts and circumstances of the case, there being no material or incriminating evidence against the accused Fareem Beg, he cannot be said to be guilty of committing the offences as charged against him and he is entitled to be acquitted. Accordingly, Accused Fareem Beg is acquitted of the offences punishable under sections 354 of IPC and section 10 of POCSO Act. 7. However, Fareem Beg is required to furnish bail bond under section 437A of Cr. P. C, which shall remain in force for a period of six months. 8. File be consigned to Record Room, after due compliance of provisions of section 437A of Cr. P. C. by Fareem Beg. Pronounced in the open Court (Balwant Rai Bansal) on 30th of May, 2017. Additional Sessions Judge­01 South District: Saket Courts: New Delhi.

[case 68]
The brief facts of the case of the appellant are that the appellant married the respondent on 17. 08. 2001 as per Christian rites and customs. Due to wedlock, they begotten two children. The respondent/wife filed a petition before the lower Court for divorce on the ground of cruelty and the appellant herein resisted the same by filing counter. However, the lower Court, only on considering the oral evidence adduced by the respondent side has granted the decree of divorce. Hence, the present appeal.
Learned counsel for the appellant would state that the divorce petition was filed on the ground of cruelty but the respondent/wife has not proved that the same. The further allegation of the respondent against the appellant that he is not maintaining the family was also not proved. Even when the respondent was cross examined as P. W. 1, she had categorically stated that her father is not helping her for running the family. Therefore, it is proved that only the appellant is maintaining the family. It was also alleged by the respondent that the appellant had assaulted the respondent and the appellant married one Beula. The said allegation was also not proved. The respondent did not give any complaint to the police for assaulting her and she did not file any document to prove the alleged marriage of the appellant with Beula. Without considering all these aspects and without any basis, the lower Court had erroneously passed the decree of divorce as against the appellant. Hence, the learned counsel prays to set aside the judgement and decree passed by the lower Court.
Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the respondent would state that though the appellant and the respondent loved each other and got married with the consent of their parents, the appellant did not spare a single paise to meet the domestic expenses and education expenses of the children. When the same was questioned, the appellant assaulted her and abused her in unparliamentary words and harassed her both physically and mentally and the same had become a routine affair in day to day life. Further, the appellant pressurized the respondent to bring more money from her parents for his extravagance. The appellant created unhealthy atmosphere in the marital home. The appellant had association with anti-social elements and was also arrested in a case of attempt to murder and later, remanded to judicial custody. The respondent mobilized funds and spent about Rs. 2 lakhs for getting the appellant on bail. But the appellant did not choose to clear the debts borrowed by the respondent for his release on bail. When the respondent advised him to rectify his adamant character, he threatened her and assaulted her. Further, the appellant developed intimacy with another lady viz. , R. Beula. When the respondent lodged a complaint against him before the All Women Police Station, he accepted that he had married her. Thereafter, the appellant deserted the respondent and two children and is living with the said Beula. The appellant had deserted the respondent and two children and unable to tolerate the cruelty, the respondent came under the shelter of her parents along with her children. Therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent would state that only on considering all the above factual aspects, the lower court had granted the decree of divorce and the same need not be interfered with.
Heard the learned counsel for the appellant, learned counsel for the respondent and perused the materials available on record.
It is not in dispute that the respondent is a Hindu and the appellant is a Christian and they got married as per the Christian rites and customs. Due to wedlock, two children were born to them. From the records, it is seen that the appellant did not provide any monetary help to the respondent. The evidence of P. W. 2, who is the father of the respondent, would also go to show that he is only looking after his daughter and her children till date and the appellant used abusive language and beat his daughter when she questioned his irresponsible behaviour. The second marriage of the appellant with one Beula and that he got a girl child through Beula was also proved by examining one P. W. 3, who is none other than the cousin brother of the appellant. Contracting second marriage while the first marriage is in existence would not only amount to bigamy but also amount to cruelty. In view of the above, we are of the view that the lower Court, on considering the oral and documentary evidence had rightly granted divorce on the ground of cruelty, with which, we find no infirmity or illegality to interfere with. Accordingly, the Civil Miscellaneous Appeal fails and the same stands dismissed. No costs. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petition is closed.

[case 70]
Dated: 14-07-2023 Shri F. A. Shah- Advocate for the appellant. Dr. Anjali Gyanani - Public Prosecutor for respondent/State. Heard on I. A. No. 7003 of 2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) Cr. P. C. filed on behalf of appellant-Akhtar Khan seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Appellant-Akhtar Khan stood convicted under Section 4(2) of POCSO Act and sentenced to undergo 20 years' R. I. with a fine of Rs. 2, 000/- and under Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and sentenced to undergo 2 years' R. I with a fine of Rs. 1, 000/- with default stipulations vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 15/12/2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act), Shivpuri (M. P. ) in Special Case No. 124/2019. Present appellant so far has undergone incarceration of about 17 months in toto, as transpired during the course of hearing. Co-accused/Appellant No. 1 in Criminal Appeal No. 838 of 2023-Shakil Khan is the biological father of the prosecutrix as after the demise of his first wife and mother of the prosecutrix, he married to co-accused Shehnaz Bano. As per prosecution story, the prosecutrix claiming herself to be 14 years of age, on 20/09/2019, lodged an FIR to the effect that for the last 4-5 years since the time her mother expired, she was ill-treated by her step-mother Shehnaz Bano off and on. She, therefore, had left the house and started living with her grand-parents. Thereafter, on 1/1/2019, while she was staying with her maternal uncle's house, step-mother Shehnaz came there and against her wishes brought her back. Thereafter, she started searching for the match though she was not major. She manipulated her marriage (Nikah) with accused/appellant Akhtar and Farukh Khan had reduced in writing the process of Nikah. After so-called solemnization of marriage (Nikah), she was subjected to forcible sexual abuse against her wishes by Akhtar from 24/08/2019 to 28/08/2019. Thereafter, accused/appellant Akhtar called her grand-parents to the Kota Court and whereafter, signing of certain documents, she was given in custody of her grand-parents. Thereafter, she came back to her grand-parents' house from Kota. It is alleged that appellant Akhtar had also threatened the prosecutrix with dire consequences, if she divulged the factum of marriage and that of sexual abuse. In the aforesaid backdrop, the prosecutrix filed the complaint and the same was registered at Crime No. 213/19. Based thereupon, investigation was set in motion. The Investigating Officer, upon collection of incriminating evidence, filed challan. The Special Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the present appellant as aforesaid. Learned counsel for the appellant while taking exception to the impugned judgement submits that the prosecutrix in her statement before the Court has clearly stated that her date of birth is 11/10/2000 as recorded in Aadhar Card and therefore, she was major as on the date of incident. However, the trial Court in Para-20 of the judgement, ignored the same and relied upon her date of birth as per the certificate of the Municipal Corporation, Kota (Ex. P/10) as 11/10/2005. That apart, she has turned hostile and belied the story of prosecution. Shakil Khan, co-convict/appellant No. 1 in Criminal Appeal No. 838 of 2023, has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27. 04. 2023. On such grounds, learned counsel prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor for respondent/State, while opposing the application supporting the judgment impugned submits that looking to the gravity of offence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to the present appellant. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the case but regard being had to the fact that co-convict/appellant No. 1 -Shakil Khan in Criminal Appeal No. 838 of 2023 has already been admitted to suspension of sentence and grant of bail vide order dated 27. 04. 2023, the present appellant has so far undergone incarceration of 17 months in toto coupled with the fact that appeal is of the year 2023 and there is no likelihood of its early hearing in near future and therefore, in the obtaining facts and circumstances, we hereby extend the benefit of suspension of sentence and grant of bail to present appellant-Akhtar Khan. Accordingly, I. A. 7003 of 2023 stands allowed and it is directed that the jail sentence of appellant-Akhtar Khan shall remain suspended during pendency of present appeal and he shall be released on bail, subject to verification of amount of fine being deposited and on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. Appellant-Akhtar Khan is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court first on 13. 09. 2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed by Office in this behalf. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of disposal of the application for suspension of sentence and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal. Certified copy as per rules.

The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 388 of 2018 of the Kilikolloor Police Station, registered under B' 354A of the IPC, B' 9(n) r/w. B' 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, and also under B'75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care & Protection of Children) Act, 2015. 3. The de facto complainant is the mother of the survivor child, who is aged about 14 years and studying in the IX Standard. She alleged that her daughter was found missing on 11. 6. 2018 from school. A crime was registered under Section 57 of the Kerala Police Act, 2011. The minor child was traced out later. She disclosed that she was in love with a boy and she had eloped with him. She also disclosed that she has had an active sexual relationship with the said boy, who is aged 19 years. In the said statement, she also disclosed that the applicant herein, who is her step-father, has touched her breasts with sexual intent on more than one occasion. On these allegations, two Crimes were registered. Crime No. 387 of 2018 was registered against her 19 year old lover under B'B' 366 and 376(2)(n) of the IPC and under B' 5(1) r/w. B' 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012. Immediately thereafter, the instant crime was registered against the applicant for sexually harassing the child. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that he has been implicated as his step-daughter felt that he was responsible for the arrest and detention of her lover. As the child was quite young, the applicant herein along with his wife had strongly opposed the relationship that she had with the accused in Crime No. 387 of 2018. It is contended that after the death of the father of the minor child about three years back, the applicant has married her mother and he has been caring and protecting the family. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant has been in custody from 12. 6. 2018 and prays that orders for his release be issued. 5. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the child shows that she has been subjected to penetrative sexual assault by the 1st accused.

I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the case diary. It appears that the applicant herein has been residing with the family after marrying the mother for the past more than two years. Allegations have been levelled against him only after registration of the crime against the lover of the child. The contention of the learned counsel that he has been implicated for his exuberance in prosecuting the lover of the survivor cannot be ruled out at this stage. Furthermore, serious allegations are levelled against the 1 st accused. The investigation appears to have progressed much and in the facts and circumstances further detention in custody of the applicant may not serve any purpose. By imposing appropriate conditions, for safeguarding the interest of the prosecution as well as the protection of the minor child, the applicant can now be released. 7. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs. 1, 00, 000/-(Rupees one lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction.

THIS PETITION COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING: -2- NC: 2024: KHC-D: 9250 CRL. P No. 101901 of 2024 ORDER Heard Sri. R. M. Javed, learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri. Praveena Y. Devareddiyavara, learned HCGP for the respondent-State. 2. The petitioner/accused No. 1 is seeking regular bail in Crime No. 47/2024 of respondent Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 498-A, 306 and 34 of IPC. Brief facts of the case are: 3. It is the case of the prosecution that the father of the deceased lodged a complaint stating that he performed the marriage of his daughter with the petitioner on 27. 12. 2018. The couple had three children. All the three children are female children. The deceased was being subjected to cruelty and harassment for having begotten three female children. She was always being scolded for not having begotten male child. In the meantime, she was also being scolded for not having proper cooking and doing household works properly. -3- NC: 2024: KHC-D: 9250 CRL. P No. 101901 of 2024 4. On 31. 03. 2024, the petitioner herein being a husband stated to have scolded his wife as she did not prepared food for dinner and it was Ramzan month. At about 8. 30 p. m. , the deceased stated to have committed suicide by hanging herself. Thereafter, it was informed to the complainant and the complainant and others went to the house of the deceased and saw that she was hanging with her saree which was tied to ceiling fan. On enquiry, the complainant learnt that there was a quarrel taken place between the husband and the deceased, consequently, she committed suicide. Therefore, complainant lodged a complaint. The jurisdictional police after registering the case conducted investigation and submitted the charge sheet. 5. It is the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the petitioner has not committed any offence, he has been falsely implicated in this case. He is having three female children and he has to take care of them and he is the only earning member of the family. The entire family is depending on his income. 6. It is further submitted that there is no nexus between the death and the petitioner. The complainant learnt that, prior to the incident there was a quarrel taken place between husband and wife. However, he is a hearsay witness. None of the witnesses have spoken about the harassment, instigation or incitement to commit suicide. The law is well settled that even if a person says 'Go and die' it is not an offence under Section 306 of IPC. Therefore, the petitioner may be enlarged on bail by imposing suitable conditions. 7. Per contra, learned HCGP vehemently opposed the bail petition and submitted that the petitioner being a husband, insulted and always abusing her in a filthy language as she could not get a male child and sometimes, she was being scolded that she was not cooking properly and not doing household work as well. The instigation to commit suicide has been established by the averments of the complaint. The entire allegations rests on accused No. 1 and therefore, he is not entitled for bail. 8. Having heard the learned counsel for respective parties and also perused the averments of the charge sheet, it appears that on 31. 03. 2024 around 4. 00 p. m. , the accused No. 1 stated to have quarreled with his wife in respect of cleaning his fasting in Ramzan period. As the petitioner had scolded his wife, she stated to have committed suicide. It was informed to the complainant and the complainant and other members came to the spot and after seeing the incident and also received the information regarding said incident, lodged a complaint. However, the entire episode of what the complainant has received is nothing but hearsay and therefore, it is appropriate to grant him bail by imposing suitable conditions. 9. Hence, I proceed to pass the following: -6- NC: 2024: KHC-D: 9250 CRL. P No. 101901 of 2024 ORDER The petition is allowed. The petitioner is ordered to be enlarged on bail in Crime No. 47/2024 of respondent Police Station, on executing a personal bond in a sum of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- (Rupees One lakh only) with one surety for the likesum to the satisfaction of the Trial Court, subject to the following conditions: a) The petitioner shall not threaten or tamper the prosecution witnesses nor hamper the proceedings of the Court. b) The petitioner shall appear before the Trial Court on all dates of hearing without fail. In case, if the petitioner violates any of the bail conditions as stated above, the prosecution will be at liberty to seek for cancellation of bail. Sd/- JUDGE RKM CT: ANB List No. : 1 Sl No. : 8

[case 74]
This is an application for regular bail under Section 439 of Cr. P. C.
The applicant is the sole accused in Crime No. 630/2020 of Mattannur Police Station for having allegedly committed the offences punishable under Sections 388 and 506(i) of the I. P. C. and under Section 4 read with Section 3(c) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The applicant was arrested on 24. 07. 2020 and he seeks regular bail. The prosecution case, in brief, is that on 20. 06. 2020, the applicant had allegedly committed unnatural offence and penetrative sexual assault on the victim, who is a 13 year old boy. The victim's father had allegedly contacted the Childline Centre and subsequently the matter was informed to the Police, in consequence of which the crime was registered. It is alleged that the incident took place in a toilet inside the compound of a hotel at a place called '19th Mile'. The applicant states that he is innocent, he has no other criminal antecedents and he is only 20 year old and that the entire allegations are false. It is stated that a similar incident had allegedly taken place on 19. 06. 2020 concerning the very same victim and he was allegedly sexually assaulted by a person named Siraj and in consequence of which Crime No. 623/2020 as lodged against the said Siraj on 26. 06. 2020 in Mattannur Police Station. Even then, crime against the applicant was not registered and ultimately it was registered only on 02. 07. 2020. The delay, according to the applicant is very crucial. It is stated that the applicant is the leader of a youth organization and because of the action taken against him for registering the crime against Siraj, the applicant has been deliberately implicated in this crime also. He was arrested on 24. 07. 2020 and has been in custody for about 58 days, and therefore, seeks regular bail. Heard the learned Counsel for the applicant and the learned Public Prosecutor. The learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently opposed application for bail stating that the applicant has committed a heinous crime attracting the offence under the I. P. C. and also for offences under Section 4(1) of the POCSO Act. It is stated that the incident which took place on 19. 06. 2020 involving the accused-Siraj and the present incident which took place on 20. 06. 2020, were in two different places. But in both these cases, the victim was sexually abused. In connection with Crime No. 623/2020 registered against Siraj, the statement of the victim was recorded by the Magistrate on 27. 06. 2020 and in that statement the victim revealed the involvement of Siraj in committing the offence on 19. 06. 2020 and also revealed the involvement of the applicant herein in another similar offence, which occurred on the successive date. The investigating officer got a copy of the statement under Section 164, Cr. P. C. from the Magistrate's Court on 02. 07. 2020 and immediately this crime was registered. Hence it is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that the delay is not very crucial. It is also submitted by the learned Counsel appearing for the applicant that Siraj, the accused in Crime No. 623/2020 of Mattannur Police Station, had approached this Court for anticipatory bail and the same was rejected by this Court. But the accused in that crime has not been apprehended. It is submitted by the learned Public Prosecutor that in case the applicant is released on bail, there is every possibility that the victim and his family members may be threatened. There is also an offence under Section 506(i) of the I. P. C. registered against the applicant and it is because the applicant had put the victim to fear of death and also causing hurt to his family members and that the victim had not come forward with a complaint against the applicant. Under the circumstances, it is submitted that the release of the applicant at this stage would be detrimental to the investigation and also to the victim and his entire family. Moreover, it is submitted that investigation is complete and final report has already been filed. The applicant's contention that he has no criminal antecedents may not make a weigh in his favour, particularly for the reason that the applicant had intimidated the victim from disclosing the alleged occurrence. The incident did not take place in the very same place and the attempt made by the applicant to suggest that the actual incident of sexually abusing the victim had taken place on 19. 06. 2020 and that the assailant was Siraj and with other political motives, the applicant has been falsely implicated as an accused. This submission cannot be accepted for the reason that in the confession statement allegedly given by the victim on 27. 06. 2020 before the Magistrate he has clearly revealed the involvement of the applicant in this crime. The fact is that both the crimes took place on consecutive days. The fact that the applicant had intimidated the victim and that subsequently the relatives of the applicant had also intimidated the family members of the victim also would go a long way in refusing bail to the applicant. In the result, I find that the applicant, who is accused of committing a very heinous crime against a child, is not entitled to any leniency, and therefore, the application is dismissed. The learned designated Court is directed to expedite the trial and in case there is any delay in concluding the trial because of the pandemic situation, the applicant is given the liberty to approach the jurisdictional court again for bail afresh.

[case 75]
THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 13-06-2018,
THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
1. This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure.
2. The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 133 of 2018
of Faroke Police Station, registered under Sections 306 and
376 of the IPC and Section 3 r/w Sec. 4, 9(m) r/w Sec. 10
and 11(v) r/w Sec. 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual
Offences Act, 2012.
3. According to the prosecution, the applicant herein is a near
relative of the victim girl who was just 15 years of age.
They became close to each other and by misusing the
relationship, started having a sexual relationship. He also
used to take photographs and videos of their intimate acts.
Later, their relationship became strained when the applicant
started to have a liking towards another girl. It is alleged
that when the victim questioned the applicant, he
threatened her with the photographs and videos which were
in his possession. This tormented the minor girl and she
decided to take her own life. Initially, the Crime was
registered on 23. 3. 2018 under Section 174 of the Cr. P. C.
Later, on the basis of an additional statement given by the
brother of the victim, the offences under the POCSO Act
and other grave offences under the IPC were incorporated.
4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that
a detailed statement of the brother of the victim as well as
all the near relatives were recorded immediately after the
registration of the Crime. No one had a case that the
applicant herein had anything to do with the minor girl. It
was much later, i. e. , on 3. 4. 2018, the allegation of sexual
abuse and other grave acts were raised by the brother. The
drastical turnaround would affect the credibility of his version
is the submission. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant
was arrested on 05. 04. 2018 and having regard to the period
of incarceration undergone and the stage of investigation,
he be released.
5. The learned Public Prosecutor while opposing the prayer
submitted that the allegations are extremely grave. The
applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl and there
is no reason to believe the version of the brother of the
victim. It is submitted that the applicant by feigning love
have sexually abused the minor child.
6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone
through the materials and records. Though the allegations
are grave, the fact remains that the investigation has made
much headway and has reached the final stages. As
submitted by the learned counsel, the brother of the victim
did not state before the investigating officer while furnishing
his initial statement that on the day prior to the death of the
child, he had an occasion to interact with her and that she
had divulged about the horrendous acts committed by the
7. Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations,
the material in support thereof, the stage of investigation
and the period of incarceration undergone, I am of the view
that the applicant can now be enlarged on bail.
8. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The
applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond
for Rs. 1, 00, 000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent
sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court
having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the
following conditions:
1). The applicant shall appear before the
Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between
9 a. m. and 10 a. m. , for 2 months or till final
report is filed, whichever is earlier.
2). The applicant shall not intimidate or attempt
to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper
with the evidence.
3). The applicant shall not commit any offence
while he is on bail.
4). The applicant shall not leave India without
the permission of the Court and if having
passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial
Court within a week; If release of the passport
is required at a later period, the applicant shall
be at liberty to move appropriate application
before the Court having jurisdiction.
In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the
jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the
application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate
orders in accordance with the law.

Karnataka High Court Ashok S/O Punnu Rathod vs The State Of Karnataka on 18 November, 2016. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA KALABURAGI BENCH DATED THIS THE 18TH DAY OF NOVEMBER, 2016 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. N. SATYANARAYANA CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 200125/2016 Between: Ashok S/o Punnu Rathod Age: 27 years, Occ: Coolie R/o Ingalgi, L. T. No. 2, Tq. Indi, Dist. Vijayapur. .. Appellant (By Smt Ratna N. Shivayogimath and Sri Sharanabasappa K. Babshetty, Advocates) And: The State of Karnataka Through the CPI Indi Circle Dist Vijayapur Represented by SPP High Court of Karnataka at Kalaburagi Bench. .. Respondent (By Sri Sheshadri Jaishankar, HCGP) This Criminal Appeal is filed under Section 374(2) of the Cr. P. C. , praying to set aside the judgment and sentence dated 19. 10. 2015 and 21. 10. 2015 passed by the special judge and II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijayapur, at Vijayapur in Special Case (POSCO) No. 21/2014, and acquit the appellant in the said case. This appeal is coming on for admission this day, the Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT The accused in Special Case (POCSO) No. 21/2014 on the file of II Addl. Sessions Judge, Vijaypur has come up in this appeal challenging the order of conviction and sentence. In the proceedings before Session's Court, charge sheet was filed against the appellant herein for the offence punishable U/Sec. 3(a) (b), 4, 5(m) and 6 of Protection of the Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and U/Sec. 376(f) of Indian Penal Code. The aforesaid charge sheet is filed based on a complaint wherein it is stated that on 6. 1. 2014 appellant herein is said to have sexually abused victim girl CW-4 namely Sujata who is aged about 8 years and resident of Ingalagi Tanda. On the ill-fated day when she had gone to attend nature call at about 6. 15 p. m. , in the evening, by luring the said child with chocolates and biscuits accused forcibly took her into the field of one Kulkarni wherein Jawar crop was standing. The accused is said to have made the child to lay on the ground, removed her under garment and slept on her. It is also accused that he inserted his finger into her vagina, pressed in it and bit her lips and subsequently committed rape on her. A complaint was filed in this behalf, wherein, investigation was conducted and thereafter charge sheet was filed and the matter was committed to Sessions wherein cognizance for the offence was taken on 18. 7. 2014. After the charges are framed, same was read over to him. Since he pleaded not guilty, matter was taken up for trial. On behalf of prosecution, in all 17 witnesses are examined and 26 documents are marked. The material objects produced at MOs-1 to 5 are also taken into consideration. In the Court below, P. Ws. 6 and 8 are the parent of victim girl. It is seen that P. Ws. 9, 10, 11 and 12 have turned hostile and did not support the prosecution. Even P. Ws. 1 and 7 panch witnesses to the spot panchanama Ex. P-1 and seizure panchanama Ex. P-2 except admitting their signature on said panchanamas, they have not supported the case. Therefore, in the Court below, they were treated as hostile witnesses and they were subjected to cross examination by prosecution. It is seen, in this proceedings that even the complainant - father of victim himself has turned hostile. However, after he was subjected to cross examination, the learned Session's Judge was able to elicit from him and as well as other witnesses that the injuries suffered by the child P. W. 2 Sujata to her private part is not due to fall in the field and it is due to heinous act committed by the accused. On going through the judgment impugned, it is clearly seen that the prosecution and learned Sessions Judge has taken enormous strain to see that the truth is elicited from the victim as well as her family members to reconstruct the whole incident to bring the guilt of accused to the books, when all of them conspired together to bury the truth either for fear of shame in the society or fearing retaliatory action from the accused. On giving careful consideration to the entire judgment of the Court below, one thing is clear that the manner in which the entire prosecution has sought to be suppressed not only by the witnesses but also by the family members considering the future of the victim girl who is aged about 8 years, this Court is sympathetic to the family of the victim who have not supported the prosecution, who have given false evidence against the interest of their own child who is victim of sexual abuse. In any event, with proper appreciation of material on record, the Session's Court has been able to bring the accused to books and convict him for the offences punishable under the aforesaid provisions. On careful consideration of the judgement impugned as well as the material available in the form of evidence of the witnesses more particularly their cross examination, it is clearly seen that no grounds are made out by the accused in Spl. Case (POCSO) No. 21/2014 to convert the finding of Session's Court in the aforesaid judgment to convert the conviction to an acquittal and also to disturb the sentence imposed on him. In fact this Court feels that considering the nature of offences, the punishment imposed is liberal one. In any event, since there is no appeal on behalf of the prosecution challenging the sentence disturbing the sentence does not arise. Accordingly, this appeal filed by the accused is hereby dismissed.

[case 78]
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in Spl. S. C. No. 151 of 2022 on the file of the Principal Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under POCSO Act, Madurai. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner is the relative of victim. When the victim was studying 11th standard, the petitioner married the victim and out of the wedlock, she became pregnant. Thereafter, the victim was admitted at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, and she gave birth to a male child on 09. 08. 2021. Based on the information given by the hospital authorities, the second respondent lodged a complaint against the petitioner. Hence the case. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner as well as the learned counsel appearing for the third respondent submitted that now, the petitioner and the third respondent married living together as husband and wife with their child, issues amicable resolved and the third respondent is not willing to proceed further with the criminal case against the petitioner. Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing, a joint Memo of Compromise filed before this Court signed by the petitioner and the third respondent and their respective counsels. The petitioner and the third respondent are present before this Court, identified by the first respondent police, as well as by the learned counsels appearing for the parties. This Court enquired both the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion. When this Court interacted with the third respondent, she confirmed her marriage with the petitioner and both living as husband and wife happily along with their child and she intends not to pursue the criminal proceedings against the petitioner. The case has been registered for offences under Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Sections 5(1), 5(j)(ii) r/w Section 6 of POCSO Act. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court. Further, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of K. Dhandapani Vs. The State by the Inspector of Police reported in 2022 SCC Online SC 1056, has held as follows: In the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the considered view that the conviction and sentence of the appellant who is maternal uncle of the prosecutrix deserves to be set aside in view of the subsequent events that have been brought to the notice of this Court. This Court cannot shut its eyes to the ground reality and disturb the happy family life of the appellant and the prosecutrix. We have been informed about the custom in Tamilnadu of the marriage of a girl with the maternal uncle. The legal position expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303 and Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Vs. State of Gujarat) reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641 were taken into consideration. Keeping the above principles in mind, let us now consider the instant case as to whether it is a fit case to quash the criminal proceedings based on the settlement arrived at between the parties. In the case at hand, though the petitioner is charged with for the offences punishable Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Sections 5(1), 5(j)(ii) r/w Section 6 of POCSO Act, now, the petitioner and the third respondent have amicably resolved their dispute between themselves. In this regard, the third respondent has also filed an affidavit. The petitioner is the sole breadwinner, the third respondent and child are solely depend on the income of the petitioner for their livelihood. The petitioner is taking care of the well being of the third respondent and child and they are showered with love and affection. Unless the conviction is set aside, the petitioner, third respondent and the child cannot lead a peaceful and happy family. Considering the welfare and wellbeing of the victim and the child, it would be appropriate to accept the attending circumstances and the compromise arrived. In view of the compromise between the parties, the possibility of conviction is also remote and bleak. In the above circumstances, continuity of the criminal proceedings would only cause oppression and prejudice to the parties, hence, in order to secure the ends of justice, this Court is inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the criminal proceedings initiated against the petitioner in Spl. S. C. No. 151 of 2022 on the file of the Principal Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under POCSO Act, Madurai, is quashed and the terms of joint compromise memo and affidavit filed by the third respondent shall form part and parcel of this order. Consequently, connected Miscellaneous Petition is closed.

In support of his submissions, he has annexed Birth Certificate to the petition.

The Birth Certificate of the Child is also on record which shows the applicant's name as father of the child. This Court has also taking into consideration the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case as well as facts of settlement and law laid down by the Apex Court [Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. , reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303, Madan Mohan Abbot Vs. State of Punjab, reported in (2008) 4 SCC 582, Nikhil Merchant Vs. Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr. , reported in 2009 (1) GLH 31, Manoj Sharma Vs. State & Ors. , reported in 2009 (1) GLH 190 and Narinder Singh & Ors. Vs. State of Punjab & Anr. reported in 2014 (2) Crime 67 (SC), ] this Court is of the considered view that further continuation of the criminal proceedings in relation to the impugned FIR would nothing but unnecessary harassment to the parties and trial thereon would be futile and further continuation of the proceedings would amount to abuse of process of law.

[case 80]
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed, invoking Section 528 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, seeking orders to call for the records in J. J. No. 120 of 2022, on the file of the Juvenile Justice Board, Sivagangai, and quash the same as illegal, improper and abuse of process of law. The case of the prosecution is that the petitioner on giving false promise to marry the victim/third respondent, sexually assaulted her without her consent and they were eloped. Based on the complaint given by the defacto complainant, who is the mother of the victim, both were secured by the Child Line and the victim was handed over to the TMSS home, Trichy. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner would submit that the second respondent lodged a complaint before the first respondent and F. I. R. registered in Crime No. 31 of 2022, after investigation, final report filed, the same taken cognizance in J. J. No. 120 of 2022, on the file of the Juvenile Justice Board, Sivagangai, for the offences under Sections 3(2)(va) of SC/ST Act, 363 of IPC r/w Sections 5(1) & 6 of POCSO Act against the petitioner. It is further submitted that the petitioner is a final year student doing Diploma Course in Government Polytechnic College. He was also a minor. Without knowing the consequences, at the adolescent age on compulsion he accompanied the victim and now he realised his mistake. Now, the victim/third respondent has also married. If the case is pending, it would affect the future of the petitioner. The petitioner is the first person in his family, who had reached to this level of education. The case is under trial. By passage of time, the parties have decided to bury their hatchet and compromise the dispute amicably among themselves. Now, both realized their mistakes, reconciled and second respondent agreeing to withdraw the complaint, not willing to pursue the case. A Joint Memo of Compromise, dated 31. 01. 2025 filed before this Court signed by the petitioner and the respondents 2 and 3 and their respective counsels. The petitioner and the respondents 2 and 3 present before this Court, identified by Mr. S. Mala, SSSI, All Women Police Station, Karaikudi, Sivagangai District, as well as by the learned counsels appearing for the parties. This Court enquired the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion. The second respondent had stated that the victim got married and she is living happily. Therefore, she had intended to withdraw the complaint against the petitioner. Realising that at the adolescent age not knowing the consequences both found missing and complaint lodged, later on enquiry the defacto complainant realised that it is her daughter, who had faced such a situation due to emotional break down complaint given, reconciled to the reality now come forward to withdraw the complaint on own volition at not on compulsion or force. The case has been registered for offence under Section 3(2)(va) of SC/ST Act, 363 of IPC r/w Sections 5(1) & 6 of POCSO Act. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court. The legal position expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303 and Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Vs. State of Gujarat) reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641 were taken into consideration. Keeping the above principles in mind, let us now consider the instant case as to whether it is a fit case to quash the criminal proceedings based on the settlement arrived at between the parties. In the case at hand, though the petitioner is charged with for the offences punishable under Section 3(2)(va) of SC/ST Act, 363 of IPC r/w Sections 5(1) & 6 of POCSO Act, now, the petitioner and the respondents 2 and 3 have amicably settled their dispute between themselves. The respondents 2 and 3 have also filed an affidavit stating that the victim had married and living happily. In view of the compromise between the parties, the possibility of conviction is also remote and bleak. In the above circumstances, continuity of the criminal proceedings would only cause oppression and prejudice to the parties, hence, in order to secure the ends of justice, this Court is inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the proceedings in J. J. No. 120 of 2022, on the file of the Juvenile Justice Board, Sivagangai, is quashed as against the petitioner. This case cannot be quoted against the petitioner in any manner for his future education, employment and career and the joint compromise memo shall form part and parcel of this order. Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed.

[case 81]
This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. , praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in Spl. Case NO. 12/2017 in Crime No. 73/2016 of Mahila Police Station,
Kalaburagi, which is registered for the offences punishable under Sections 363, 376(2)(n) of IPC and Sections 4, 6, 7, 11 and 12 of POCSO Act and also Section 10 of Child Marriage
Restraint Act. Brief facts leading to filing of the complaint are that, on 20. 04. 2016 at about 7. 00 p. m. as the complainant was in her house and there was nobody in the house, petitioner came to the house of the victim, threatened and kidnapped her and thereafter he took her to his uncle's house at Kalaburagi. On 02. 05. 2016, the sister of the accused Roopa, Mahadevi and uncle Sharanappa all together took her to Nagavi Yallamma temple at Chittapur Taluka and there they solemnized the marriage of the victim with accused forcibly. Thereafter, accused kept the victim girl in his house at Kalaburagi and there he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her and the mother of the accused also helped the accused by way of abusing him to keep her in the house. It is further alleged that accused used to sexually harass her and used to have forcible sexual intercourse with her. With the help of others, she escaped and subsequently on 14. 12. 2016 she filed a written complaint. On the basis of the said complaint, a case has been registered against the accused persons. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor appearing for respondent-State. The main grounds urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner are that the complaint is baseless and there is a delay in filing the complaint. The said complaint has been filed only with an intention to harass the petitioner. It is also contended that no marriage as alleged in the complaint has been taken place. It is also contended that already charge-sheet has been filed and the remaining accused persons have not been shown as accused. It is further contended that the medical certificate reveals that there is no offence as alleged in the complaint and there are no external injuries found on the victim girl. It is further contended that if the petitioner is detained in custody, it is going to affect his right. Further, it is contended that the petitioner is the permanent resident of Kalaburagi and he is the sole earning member. Further, it is contended that if the petitioner is released on bail, he is ready to abide by the conditions to be imposed by this Court and ready to offer sureties. On these grounds, he prays for allowing the petition. On the contrary, learned Additional State Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State would contend that the petitioner by kidnapping the victim, forcibly got married and thereafter he had sexual assault on a minor girl, who is aged about 16 years. He would also contend that the victim girl has given statement before the Magistrate and the same has been recorded under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. and the learned Magistrate has also been shown as a party to the witness. He would further contend that in the statement of the victim, she has been categorically deposed that the petitioner has threatened and thereafter he had sexually assaulted her. He would further contend that because of the threat and other things the complaint was filed belatedly. At this juncture, if the petitioner is released on bail, he may tamper with the prosecution witnesses, he may abscond and he may not be available for trial. On these grounds, he prays for dismissal of the petition. I have gone through the copy of the complaint and other material produced along with the petition. By going through the contents of the complaint and other material, it indicates that the petitioner had kidnapped the victim on 20. 04. 2016, thereafter he got married her forcibly on 02. 05. 2016 and thereafter by threatening her he harassed her sexually and had a sexual intercourse with her. If the medical certificate is perused, it indicates that there is sexual assault has been made on the victim girl. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that there are no external injuries and other signs of sexual assault, but by going through the statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. and the medical certificate, they corroborate with the sexual assault committed by the petitioner. When the petitioner has committed a sexual assault on a minor girl, under such circumstances, the said offence is considered to be serious and he does not deserve any consideration. As such, the bail petition stands dismissed. However, since the petitioner is in custody, the Trial Court is directed to expedite the matter.

J. Act, 2015. A police report dated 25. 8. 2020 was also submitted, which also does not find favour with the revisionist.

[case 87]
O R D E R 1. Vide this order I shall decide the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant/CCL 'S' through his father against the order dated 13. 01. 2017 passed by the Ld. Juvenile Justice Board­II Delhi wherein the Ld. JJB has directed that medical opinion with regard to the age of the CCL/appellant be obtained by a duly constituted medical board at Safdarjung Hospital. 2. The appellant/CCL was apprehended by the police during the investigation of FIR No. 351/16, PS Lajpat Nagar which was initially registered U/s 307/34 IPC but subsequently due to death of the victim, Section 302 IPC was also added in the said case. 3. The appellant/CCL claimed juvenility and consequently age determination inquiry was conducted by the Ld. JJB­II. During the course of said inquiry it has come on record that after his apprehension the appellant/CCL had furnished his school documents in the nature of Scholar's register and transfer certificate Form purportedly issued from Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. However the said document was found to be forged upon verification and subsequently yet another school record in the nature of school leaving certificate purportedly issued by Principal, Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Makanpur Khadar, Post Dankaur District, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh was filed alongwith bail application of appellant/CCL. In the age determination inquiry, the Ld. Board has examined CW­1, Principal of the said school and CW­2, Shri Harjit Panwar, Head Clerk, Transport Authority, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi. The Ld. JJB also examined the appellant/CCL under section 165 Evidence Act wherein the CCL claimed that he had taken admission in Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh but he did not attend any classes. He was also examined in order to ascertain the documents on the basis of which he had set up his date of birth of 08. 09. 1992 before the Transport Authority at Delhi for procuring his driving licence but the Ld. Counsel for the CCL has contended that the said driving licence was procured through a tout/middle man. The Juvenile Justice Board placed reliance on the judgments titled, 'Om Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr. ', 'Parag Bhati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. ' and other judgment titled 'Mukarrab Vs. State of UP' to hold that the plea of minority set up by the CCL is not free from ambiguity and doubts. The JJB directed for obtaining the medical opinion based on scientific investigations as regards age of CCL. 4. The Ld. counsel for appellant has vehemently argued that once the Juvenile Justice Board had examined CW­1, Principal of Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Uttar Pradesh then there was no occasion for the JJB to order for constitution of medical board for seeking medical opinion in respect of the age of the appellant. 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Om Prakash vs. State of Rajasthan (Supra)' has decided about the approach to be adopted in age enquiry in grave and heinous offences and held that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the age of 18 years on the date of the incident, he would be entitled for this special protection under the Juvenile Justice Act. But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach, cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. 6. Thus in a circumstance where the Ld JJB cannot arrive at a conclusive finding regarding the age of the accused, the opinion of the medical experts based on x­ray and ossification test can be obtained. 7. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile based on cogent evidence regarding his minority as the benefit of the possibilities of two views regarding the age of the alleged accused involved in grave and serious offence cannot be allowed merely upon doubtful school admission record. 8. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order of the Ld. JJB for obtaining the medical opinion can not be faulted by appellant/CCL who gives forged and fabricated school documents regarding his age initially and also uses documents showing his majority for obtaining Driving Licence from Transport authority/Govt Dept but hides the said documents when involved in case of heinous nature.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM PRESENT: THE HONOURABLE MR.

STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM - 682 031. 2. THE SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE, FAROKE POLICE STATION, KOZHIKODE DISTRICT - 673 001. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI. AMJAD ALI THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 13-06-2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V, J B. A No. 3288 of 2018 Dated this the 13th day of June, 2018 ORDER 1. This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 133 of 2018 of Faroke Police Station, registered under Sections 306 and 376 of the IPC and Section 3 r/w Sec. 4, 9(m) r/w Sec. 10 and 11(v) r/w Sec. 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. 3. According to the prosecution, the applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl who was just 15 years of age. They became close to each other and by misusing the relationship, started having a sexual relationship. He also used to take photographs and videos of their intimate acts. Later, their relationship became strained when the applicant started to have a liking towards another girl. It is alleged that when the victim questioned the applicant, he threatened her with the photographs and videos which were in his possession. This tormented the minor girl and she decided to take her own life. Initially, the Crime was registered on 23. 3. 2018 under Section 174 of the Cr. P. C. Later, on the basis of an additional statement given by the brother of the victim, the offences under the POCSO Act and other grave offences under the IPC were incorporated. 4. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that a detailed statement of the brother of the victim as well as all the near relatives were recorded immediately after the registration of the Crime. No one had a case that the applicant herein had anything to do with the minor girl. It was much later, i. e. , on 3. 4. 2018, the allegation of sexual abuse and other grave acts were raised by the brother. The drastic turn around would affect the credibility of his version is the submission. Finally, it is submitted that the applicant was arrested on 05. 04. 2018 and having regard to the period of incarceration undergone and the stage of investigation, he be released. 5. The learned Public Prosecutor while opposing the prayer submitted that the allegations are extremely grave. The applicant herein is a near relative of the victim girl and there is no reason to believe the version of the brother of the victim. It is submitted that the applicant by feigning love have sexually abused the minor child. 6. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the materials and records. Though the allegations are grave, the fact remains that the investigation has made much headway and has reached the final stages. As submitted by the learned counsel, the brother of the victim did not state before the investigating officer while furnishing his initial statement that on the day prior to the death of the child, he had an occasion to interact with her and that she had divulged about the horrendous acts committed by the applicant. 7. Having regard to the nature and gravity of the allegations, the material in support thereof, the stage of investigation and the period of incarceration undergone, I am of the view that the applicant can now be enlarged on bail. 8. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs. 1, 00, 000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between 9 a. m. and 10 a. m. , for 2 months or till final report is filed, whichever is earlier. 2). The applicant shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. 3). The applicant shall not commit any offence while he is on bail. 4). The applicant shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, the applicant shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

Fayazuddin Khan@Badal Khan vs State Of Odisha & Others. .. .. .. .. . on 4 March, 2025. THE HIGH COURT OF ORISSA AT CUTTACK CRLMC No. 3850 of 2024 (In the matter of an application under Section 528 of the Bharatiya Nagarika Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 r/w Section 482 of the Code Of Criminal Procedure, 1973 ) Fayazuddin Khan@Badal Khan. .. .. .. Petitioner -Versus- State of Odisha & Others. .. .. .. Opposite Parties For the Petitioner: Mr. Amitav Tripathy, Advocate For the Opposite Parties: Mr. Bibekananda Nayak, Additional Government Advocate CORAM: THE HONOURABLE SHRI JUSTICE SIBO SANKAR MISHRA Date of Hearing: 18. 02. 2025: : Date of Judgment: 04. 03. 2025 S. S. Mishra, J. The petitioner has filed the present application under Section 528 of the BNSS, 2023 r/w Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. , 1973, seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings arising out of Nayagarh P. S. Case No. 60 of 2022, corresponding to T. R. Case No. 135 of 2022, pending before the learned Additional Sessions Judge-cum-Special Court under the POCSO Act, Nayagarh. The prosecution case originates from an FIR lodged by the informant on 10. 05. 2022, alleging that on 09. 05. 2022, the petitioner kidnapped her minor daughter (Opposite Party No. 3) and took away gold ornaments and cash of Rs. 8, 000/- from their house. Based on these allegations, Nayagarh P. S. Case No. 60 of 2022 was registered under Sections 363/366/376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) read with Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Upon completion of the investigation, a charge sheet was filed, and the learned trial court took cognizance of the offences. During the pendency of the trial, the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 3 entered into a marital relationship after the latter attained the age of majority. They are now living together as husband and wife, and the informant (Opposite Party No. 2) has expressed her willingness not to prosecute the matter further. Mr. Tripathy, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the entire case was based on a love affair between the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 3, which was opposed by their families due to religious differences. Consequently, both the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 3 left their respective homes and later solemnized their marriage. It is further submitted that at the time of the alleged incident, Opposite Party No. 3 was a minor, and due to that, the police rescued her and handed over to her parents. However, upon attaining majority, she voluntarily married the petitioner, and they are now living together happily. Learned Counsel for the petitioner contends that continuation of the criminal proceedings would serve no useful purpose, as the alleged victim does not support the prosecution case, and the matter has been amicably resolved between the parties. Even all the family members of the Opposite Party No. 3 after having agreed to the alliance, will not support prosecution case. It is also submitted that the informant (Opposite Party No. 2) has no objection to quash the proceedings and is ready to submit an affidavit before this Court stating the same. Mr. Nayak, the learned Additional Government Advocate appearing for the State of Odisha opposes the prayer for quashing on the ground that serious offences under Sections 376(2)(n) IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act have been invoked against the petitioner. Relying on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramji Lal Bairwa & Another v. State of Rajasthan & Others, Mr. Nayak has contended that cases involving offences under the POCSO Act cannot be quashed merely on the basis of a compromise between the parties, as offences are considered to be the crimes against society at large and not just against an individual victim. He further submits that indulgence by this Court at this stage would cause defeat of the object of the POCSO Act. Learned counsel for the State submits that even if the victim and her family do not wish to proceed with the case, the gravity of the offence and the legislative intent behind the POCSO Act necessitate that the trial be conducted in accordance with law. The applicability of the principle laid down in the recent Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in Ramji Lal Bairwa v. State of Rajasthan (supra) vis-à-vis the present case needs to be delve upon. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held as under: - 'Thus, in unambiguous terms this Court held that before exercising the power under Section 482, Cr. P. C. the High Court must have due regard to the nature and gravity of the crime besides observing and holding that heinous and serious offences could not be quashed even though a victim or victim's family and the offender had settled the dispute. This Court held that such offences are not private in nature and have a serious impact on the society. .. ' With that analysis in mind, the implications of the case suggest that it is necessary to also consider the welfare of the child and the enactment's intent. Accordingly, justice should be served while taking into account each actor’s rights and standing in this complex case.

HEARD THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER AND THE LEARNED HIGH COURT GOVERNMENT PLEADER APPEARING FOR THE RESPONDENT-STATE. 3. THE ALLEGATION FOUND AGAINST HIM IS THAT ON 20. 3. 2017 AT ABOUT 3. 00 P. M. HE TOOK THE DAUGHTER OF THE COMPLAINANT AGED ABOUT 4 YEARS TO HIS HOUSE AND SEXUALLY ABUSED HER. A REPORT IN THIS REGARD WAS MADE AT 11. 15 P. M. ON THE SAME DAY. 4. THE INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND CHARGE SHEET IS FILED. THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONER SUBMITS THAT THE STATEMENT OF THE GIRL UNDER SECTION 161 Cr. P. C. WAS RECORDED BY THE INVESTIGATION OFFICER TAKING THE HELP OF THE SOCIAL WORKER, AS THE VICTIM GIRL DOES NOT KNOW KANNADA. THE COMPLAINANT IS NORTH INDIAN. THEN HE REFERS TO THE REMAND APPLICATION TO ARGUE THAT IF REALLY THE STATEMENT OF THE VICTIM GIRL WAS RECORDED IN THE POLICE STATION ON 21. 3. 2017, A MENTION OF IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE REMAND APPLICATION DATED 22. 3. 2017. IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THE STATEMENT AND THEREFORE VERACITY OF THE STATEMENT RECORDED ON 21. 3. 2017 CAN BE DISBELIEVED.

HER ASSISTANCE WAS TAKEN BECAUSE CHILD DID NOT KNOW KANNADA AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSLATION SHE WAS ASKED TO ASSIST DURING THE INVESTIGATION. IT FURTHER SHOWS THAT THE VICTIM GIRL ANSWERED IN GADWALI LANGUAGE. THE FATHER OF THE GIRL TRANSLATED THE ANSWERS GIVEN BY THE CHILD IN GADWALI LANGUAGE INTO HINDI AND THEREAFTER HINDI VERSION WAS TRANSLATED INTO KANNADA. THEREFORE, AT THIS STAGE THE INTEREST OF THE CHILD FATHER IS FORTHCOMING. MOREOVER THE REMAND APPLICATION DATED 23. 3. 2017 SHOULD HAVE CONTAINED A REFERENCE TO THE STATEMENT DATED 21. 3. 2017 AND IT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THIS. IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS POSSIBLE TO INFER THAT VERACITY IN THE COMPLAINT AS WELL AS THE STATEMENT OF THE GIRL RECORDED ON 21. 3. 2017 CAN BE VIEWED WITH ASKANCE. PRIMA-FACIE MATERIALS CAN BE SAID NOT TO EXIST. THEREFORE, BAIL CAN BE GRANTED.

This Court enquired both the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion. The second respondent had stated that she and the petitioner are husband and wife and considering their children' future, she intends to withdraw the complaint against the petitioner. She has also filed filed an affidavit. The relevant portion of the affidavit reads as follows: “. .. .. .. .. .. .4. It is submitted that the petitioner herein is my husband, out of wedlock we have blessed with one male and one female child. During my matrimonial life some misunderstanding were arose between I and the petitioner. Therefore, I lodged complaint against the petitioner. Now by taking consideration of the future life of our children I and the petitioner amicably settle the entire issue without making any allegations each other. As a result, I show my intent to drop the criminal proceedings pending against the petitioner herein. In view of the same, I have no objection to quash the FIR in Crime NO. 31 of 2024 on the file of the first respondent dated 22. 07. 2024. .. .. .. .. .. .. ”. The case has been registered for offences under Sections 11(1) and 12 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court. The legal position expressed by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Gian Singh vs. State of Punjab and another reported in (2012) 10 SCC 303 and Parbatbhai Aahir @ Parbatbhai Vs. State of Gujarat) reported in (2017) 9 SCC 641 were taken into consideration. Keeping the above principles in mind, let us now consider the instant case as to whether it is a fit case to quash the criminal proceedings based on the settlement arrived at between the parties. In the case at hand, though FIR has been registered for the offences punishable under Sections 11(1) and 12 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, now, the petitioner and the second respondent have amicably settled their dispute between themselves. The second respondent has also filed an affidavit. The dispute between husband and wife has been magnified and stamped as an POCSO offence. The victim is minor daughter. Now, all are residing together as a family happily. In view of the compromise between the parties, the possibility of conviction is also remote and bleak. In the above circumstances, continuity of the criminal proceedings would only cause oppression and prejudice to the parties, hence, in order to secure the ends of justice, this Court is inclined to quash the criminal proceedings. Accordingly, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and FIR in Crime No. 31 of 2024 registered against the petitioner on the file of the first respondent, is hereby quashed and the terms of joint compromise memo and affidavit filed by the second respondent shall form part and parcel of this order.

Child In Conflict With Law Through His. .. vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 23 September, 2023
Author: Rohit Arya
Bench: Rohit Arya
IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH
CRA No. 10440 of 2023
(CHILD IN CONFLICT WITH LAW THROUGH HIS GUARDIAN/ FATHER Vs THE STATE OF MADHYA
Dated: 23-09-2023
Ms. Ayushi Vyas, learned counsel for the appellant.
Mr. N. S. Tomar, learned Public Prosecutor for the respondent - State.
Heard on I. A. No. 15174/2023, which is first application under Section 389(1) of Cr. P. C. moved on behalf of appellant No. 1 - Child IN Conflict with law seeking suspension of sentence and grant of bail.
Appellant stands convicted under Section 450 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs. 500/-, under Section 328 of IPC and sentenced to undergo 05 years RI with fine of Rs. 500/- and under Section 6 of POCSO Act read with Section 376(D) of IPC and sentenced to undergo 20 years' RI with fine of Rs. 50, 000/- with default stipulation vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 01. 08. 2023 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Bhind (Madhya Pradesh) in Special Case (ST No. ) No. 80/2021. As per prosecution story, while parents of the prosecutrix had gone away to attend a marriage, her brother and sister were sleeping on the terrace and she was sleeping in the courtyard on the ground floor, on 11. 05. 2019, at about 12 in the intervening night, accused - Jitendra, Rohit and present appellant (juvenile) entered the house from terrace area and caught hold the prosecutrix. She was dragged in a room, where she was forced to consume liquor, while present appellant-(juvenile) and another accused were standing outside the room. Main accused Jitendra committed rape on the prosecutrix. Accordingly, case has been registered. Upon filing of challan, the case was committed for trial to the Sessions Court. The Sessions Court upon critical evaluation of the evidence placed on record has convicted and sentenced the appellant as referred above. Learned counsel for the appellant at the first instance fairly submits that the appellant (juvenile) has already suffered the jail incarceration for almost three years. There is no allegation of either violating the personal liberty of the prosecutrix or committing rape. Instead, the sole allegation against him is that he entered the house and was standing outside the room, where she was sexually abused by the main accused Jitendra. As such the conviction of the appellant under Section 376(D) of IPC and 5(G) and 6 of POCSO is fully unwarranted and based on surmises and conjecture. The appellant even otherwise, has no criminal antecedents. It is further submitted that co-accused Rohit has already been granted bail by this Court and the case of the present appellant is akin to his case. Hence, prays for suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent-State opposes the application supporting the order impugned with the submission that the appellant and two accused persons had entered the house of the prosecutrix with common intention of commission of rape. The active participation is well specific from the story of the prosecution and the evidence placed on record during trial. Hence, no exception can be taken in the matter of suspension of sentence and grant of bail. Upon hearing counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon rival contentions touching merits of the matter but looking to nature of allegation and since the appellant is having no criminal record, the application deserves to be allowed. Accordingly, we allow the application and it is directed that the jail sentence of the appellant - (juvenile) shall remain suspended and he be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- (Rupees Two Lakh only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court subject to verification of factum regarding deposit of fine amount. Appellant is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court on 23. 11. 2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf with following further conditions: - (i) the concerned jail authorities are directed that before releasing the appellant, the medical examination of the appellant be conducted through the jail doctor and if it is prima facie found that she is having any symptoms of COVID-19, then the consequential follow up action or any further test required be undertaken immediately. If not, appellant shall be released on bail in terms of the conditions imposed in this order; (ii) violation of conditions, State is free to apply for cancellation of bail. Accordingly, I. A. No. 15174/2023 stands allowed and disposed of. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I. A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal.

[case 94]
O R D E R 1. Vide this order I shall decide the appeal filed on behalf of the appellant/CCL 'S' through his father against the order dated 13. 01. 2017 passed by the Ld. Juvenile Justice Board­II Delhi wherein the Ld. JJB has directed that medical opinion with regard to the age of the CCL/appellant be obtained by a duly constituted medical board at Safdarjung Hospital. 2. The appellant/CCL was apprehended by the police during the investigation of FIR No. 351/16, PS Lajpat Nagar which was initially registered U/s 307/34 IPC but subsequently due to death of the victim, Section 302 IPC was also added in the said case. 3. The appellant/CCL claimed juvenility and consequently age determination inquiry was conducted by the Ld. JJB­II. During the course of said inquiry it has come on record that after his apprehension the appellant/CCL had furnished his school documents in the nature of Scholar's register and transfer certificate Form purportedly issued from Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh. However the said document was found to be forged upon verification and subsequently yet another school record in the nature of school leaving certificate purportedly issued by Principal, Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Makanpur Khadar, Post Dankaur District, Gautam Budh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh was filed alongwith bail application of appellant/CCL. In the age determination inquiry, the Ld. Board has examined CW­1, Principal of the said school and CW­2, Shri Harjit Panwar, Head Clerk, Transport Authority, Sheikh Sarai, New Delhi. The Ld. JJB also examined the appellant/CCL under section 165 Evidence Act wherein the CCL claimed that he had taken admission in Chaudhary Beerpal Singh Inter College, Barah Bulandshahar, Uttar Pradesh but he did not attend any classes. He was also examined in order to ascertain the documents on the basis of which he had set up his date of birth of 08. 09. 1992 before the Transport Authority at Delhi for procuring his driving licence but the Ld. Counsel for the CCL has contended that the said driving licence was procured through a tout/middle man. The Juvenile Justice Board placed reliance on the judgments titled, 'Om Prakash Vs. State of Rajasthan & Anr. ', 'Parag Bhati Vs. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr. ' and other judgment titled 'Mukarrab Vs. State of UP' to hold that the plea of minority set up by the CCL is not free from ambiguity and doubts. The JJB directed for obtaining the medical opinion based on scientific investigations as regards age of CCL. 4. The Ld. counsel for appellant has vehemently argued that once the Juvenile Justice Board had examined CW­1, Principal of Dhani Ram Sharma Public School, Uttar Pradesh then there was no occasion for the JJB to order for constitution of medical board for seeking medical opinion in respect of the age of the appellant. 5. The Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Om Prakash vs. State of Rajasthan (Supra)' has decided about the approach to be adopted in age enquiry in grave and heinous offences and held that if there is a clear and unambiguous case in favour of the juvenile accused that he was a minor below the age of 18 years on the date of the incident, he would be entitled for this special protection under the Juvenile Justice Act. But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach, cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. 6. Thus in a circumstance where the Ld JJB cannot arrive at a conclusive finding regarding the age of the accused, the opinion of the medical experts based on x­ray and ossification test can be obtained. 7. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would thus apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile based on cogent evidence regarding his minority. 8. In view of the above discussions, the impugned order of the Ld. JJB for obtaining the medical opinion can not be faulted by appellant/CCL who gives forged and fabricated school documents regarding his age initially and also uses documents showing his majority for obtaining Driving Licence from Transport authority/Govt Dept but hides the said documents when involved in case of heinous nature.

Sri Vamshi @ Vamshi Krishna, vs The State Of Karnataka on 24 April, 2018. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 24th DAY OF APRIL, 2018 BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SREENIVAS HARISH KUMAR CRIMINAL PETITION No. 1639 OF 2018 BETWEEN Sri. Vamshi @ Vamshi Krishna s/o Veeresh @ Salappa aged about 19 years r/at. No. 1, 1st Main Road 1st Cross, J. J. Nagar Bangalore - 560078. .. .Petitioner (By Sri. B. V. Pinto, Advocate) AND The State of Karnataka By J. J. Nagar Police Station, By State Public Prosecutor, High Court of Karnataka, Bengaluru-560001. .. .Respondent (By Sri. K. Nageshwarappa, HCGP) This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. praying to enlarge the petitioner on bail in Crime No. 130/2017 of Jagajeevanram Nagar Police Station, Bengaluru and in Spl. C. C. No. 343/2017 pending on the file of LIV Additional City Civil and Sessions Judge (CCH-55), sitting in the Child Friendly Court, Bengaluru Urban District for the offences punishable under Section 376 of IPC and Section 4, 6, 8 and 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. This Criminal Petition coming on for orders this day, the court made the following: ORDER This is a petition under Section 439 Cr. P. C. The petitioner is facing trial in Spl. C. C. No. 343/2017 pending on the file of Addl. City Civil and Sessions Judge and Child Friendly Court (CCH-55), Bengaluru. He is implicated for the offences punishable under Sections 4, 6, 8 and 12 of POCSO Act, 2012 and Section 376 of IPC. The allegations made against the petitioner are that on 15. 05. 2017 at about 10. 00 p. m. , the petitioner took the complainant's daughter aged about 5 years to his house and sexually abused the child. The learned counsel for the petitioner argues by referring to the medical report that the doctor who examined the victim girl soon after lodging of the complaint gave an opinion that the victim girl is not used to the act of sexual intercourse and that he also did not find the signs of recent sexual activity. Then he refers to FSL report and argues that even this report has come negative. Therefore, the complaint made against the petitioner is a false one. Moreover, two prime witnesses who have been examined in the court have not at all spoken anything against the petitioner. Since these two witnesses have been examined, there are no chances that the petitioner is likely to influence the other witnesses. The petitioner has been in custody for the last one year and the trial may take some more time to get concluded. Hence the petitioner can be enlarged on bail. On the other hand, the High Court Government Pleader submits that just because two witnesses have not supported the prosecution case, it cannot be said that the other witnesses do not support. The two witnesses who have been examined are child witnesses. The answers given by them to the preliminary questions put to them show very well that they are competent witnesses. This evidence may or may not be believed by the court. The medical report in fact supports the prosecution case because the doctor has noticed redness over labia minora. The mother has to be examined. There are no grounds to grant bail. Usually, when the trial is pending, after conclusion of recording of evidence of two or three witnesses, the accused would move for bail if the witnesses turn hostile. Whether to grant bail or not after examination of some of the witnesses depends on facts and circumstances. Just because some witnesses turn hostile, it cannot be a ground for granting bail. However, this cannot be a yardstick always for denying the bail. Now in this case PW-1 is the victim girl. Preliminary questions were put to her and thereafter she was subjected to examination. If the answers given by the witnesses are seen, it appears that she was not able to comprehend the questions put to her. The other witness is a boy of 8 years. He too has not supported the prosecution case. According to prosecution, PW-1 and 2 are the prime witnesses. The trial court can appreciate their evidence. Merely because two witnesses have turned hostile it cannot be said that the other witnesses do not support. But at this stage what is found is that in view of examination of prime witnesses having been completed, the possibility of other witnesses being influenced by the petitioner can be safely ruled out. Hence the following order: (a) Petition is allowed. (b) Petitioner, who is facing trial in Spl. C. C. No. 343/2017, on the file of LIV Additional City Civil and Session Judge (CCH-55), Bengaluru shall be released on bail on his executing bond for a sum of Rs. 1, 00, 000/- (Rupees One Lakh only) and providing two sureties for the like sum to the satisfaction of the trial Court. The petitioner is also subjected to the following conditions: 1) He shall regularly appear before the Court during trial. 2) He shall not threaten the witnesses and tamper with the prosecution evidence.

Smt. Kanijan vs State Of U. P. on 23 January, 2025. HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD. Neutral Citation No. - 2025: AHC: 11561. Court No. - 65. Case: - CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 1156 of 2025. Applicant: - Smt. Kanijan. Opposite Party: - State of U. P. Counsel for Applicant: - Mohammad Waseem. Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Krishan Pahal, J. 1. List has been revised. 2. Heard Sri Rajesh Kumar Verma, Advocate holding brief of Sri Mohammad Waseem, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Arun Kumar, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the material placed on record. 3. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 208 of 2024, under Sections 498-A, 304-B I. P. C. and 3/4 Dowry Prohibition Act, Police Station- Nawabganj, District- Bareilly, during the pendency of trial. 4. As per prosecution story, the marriage of son of the applicant was solemnized with the deceased person as per Muslim Rites about three years before her death. The applicant and other family members are stated to have subjected her to cruelty for demand of dowry and also used to torture her by saying her to be unable to bear a child, as such, committed her murder by administering some poisonous material on 1. 6. 2024. 5. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. The applicant is the mother-in-law of the deceased person and has nothing to do with the said offence. There are general allegations in the FIR. At the one hand it is being stated that dowry was demanded from the victim and on the other hand it is stated that she was subjected to torture by calling her unable to bear a child (Banjh), as such, the applicant is entitled for bail. 6. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against her. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal antecedent of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 31. 8. 2024 and she is ready to cooperate with trial. In case, the applicant is released on bail, she will not misuse the liberty of bail. 7. Learned A. G. A. has vehemently opposed the bail application. 8. The Supreme Court in Kahkashan Kausar @ Sonam vs The State of Bihar, reported in 2022 (6) SCC 599 has categorically stated that the Courts should be careful in proceeding against the distant relatives in crimes pertaining to matrimonial disputes and dowry deaths. The relatives of the husband should not be roped in on the basis of omnibus allegations unless specific instances of their involvement in the crime are made out. 9. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself. 10. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme Court passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. , 2022 INSC 690 and Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed. 11. Let the applicant- Smt. Kanijan, who is involved in aforementioned case crime be released on bail on her furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned subject to following conditions. Further, before issuing the release order, the sureties be verified. (i) The applicant shall not tamper with evidence. (ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr. P. C. /351 B. N. S. S. If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against her in accordance with law. 12. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. 13. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses. Order Date: - 23. 1. 2025

Deepak Rajak vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 5 October, 2023. IN THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH AT GWALIOR CRA No. 5 of 2023. Dated: 05-10-2023. Mr. Naval Kishore Gupta - learned counsel for appellant. Mr. Rajeev Upadhyay - Public Prosecutor for respondent - State. Heard on I. A. No. 17030/2023, which is second application under Section 389 (1) of Cr. P. C. for suspension of sentence and grant of bail filed on behalf of appellant- Deepak Rajak. Appellant stood convicted under Section 363 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v-a) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (in short, Act), Section 366 of IPC r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and 376(3) r/w 3(2)(v) of the Act and sentenced to undergo two years RI with fine of Rs. 1, 000/-, imprisonment for life with fine of Rs. 1, 000/- and imprisonment for life with fine of Rs. 2, 000/- with default stipulation respectively vide judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 24. 11. 2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act 2012), Shivpuri (M. P. ) in S. C. No. 90/2021. Appellant so far has undergone incarceration of three years and two months. A s per prosecution story, an FIR was lodged on 29. 02. 2020 by the prosecutrix accompanied by her parents and brother to the effect that on 26. 01. 2020 while her father was ill and her mother & sister had gone to the field and she was alone at the home, the present appellant, who was her neighbour, came to her house. He made false promise of marriage and thereafter manipulated her and she was subjected to sexual abuse. Besides, the appellant had taken her to Jhansi and went to take the ticket while leaving her at Jhansi platform. Thereafter, the prosecutrix came back home by traveling in the bus. On such allegations, the investigation was started. Upon completion of investigation, challan was filed and the case was committed to the Sessions Court for Trial. The Sessions Court after proper evaluation of evidence placed on record convicted and sentenced the appellant as mentioned above. Learned counsel for the appellant, while taking exception to the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentence submits that the appellant is innocent and has been falsely implicated. It is a case of consent. The prosecutrix on her own volition had gone with the appellant. There is delay of one month in lodging of FIR. There is no medical evidence which supports the case of prosecution. As per Ex. D-5, medical ossification report, her age is 16-18 years. The prosecutrix's father PW-15 himself stated that date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was mentioned in the school record on hypothetical basis, for which they have no record. In the aforesaid circumstances, the impugned judgment is based on surmises and conjectures and suffers from vice of perversity. The appellant has already suffered incarceration of 3 years and 2 months. There is no likelihood of the early disposal of the appeal in the near future. Under such circumstances, learned counsel for the appellant prays that benefit of suspension of sentence may be extended to present appellant. Per contra, learned counsel for the State while supporting the impugned judgment opposes the suspension application and prays for its rejection with submission that the date-of-birth of the prosecutrix was 10. 06. 2007 and the incident took place on 26. 01. 2020 and thus, at that time she was 14 years of age, therefore, her consent is irrelevant. It is a case of manipulation and sexual abuse of a minor child at the hands of the present appellant. Hence no exception can be taken in the impugned judgment for suspension of sentence. Upon hearing learned counsel for the parties, though this Court refrains from commenting upon the rival contentions so advanced touching the merits of the case, but regard being had to the fact that that present appellant so far has suffered incarceration of 03 years and 02 months and there is no likelihood of early hearing of the appeal, in the obtaining facts and circumstances, appellant is held entitled to suspension of jail sentence. Accordingly, I. A. No. 17030/2023 stands allowed and it is directed that jail sentence of appellant shall remain suspended during pendency of the present appeal and he shall be released on bail subject to verification of the factum of depositing the fine amount and on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 2, 00, 000/- (Rupees Two Lacs only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the Trial Court. He is directed to appear before the Registry of this Court first on 07. 12. 2023 and on other subsequent dates as may be fixed in this behalf. Observations on facts, if any, are only for the purpose of deciding the instant I. A. and shall have no bearing on the merits of the appeal. A copy of this order be sent to the concerned Court below for compliance. Certified copy as per rules.

OTHER PRESENT: SRI. SAIGI JACOB PALATTY, PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 11. 04. 2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ALEXANDER THOMAS, J. ================== B. A. No. 7643 of 2018 ================== Dated this the 11th day of April, 2019 ORDER The petitioner is the accused in Crime No. 1056/2018 of Valapattaham Police Station, registered for offences punishable under Secs. 7, 8, 9(l) and 10 of the POCSO Act. 2. The gist of the prosecution case is that the mother of the victim girl aged 11 years has been working as an employee of the bakery run by the petitioner accused and that at times, the mother used to go out for collection purposes to take care some of her other business activities, at which time, she used to leave her child in the bakery and that the petitioner has sexually abused the minor victim girl on those occasions, by kissing and embracing her, etc. and that the petitioner had attempted to bite her lips, and that the child had beaten him and had told the incident to the mother, etc. 3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the abovesaid allegations have been falsely foisted against the petitioner and that the mother of the victim girl had left the employment of the petitioner's bakery and had joined the employment of one Vamban, who is running a medical shop. That the petitioner had earlier advanced certain monies to Vamban and the cheque issued by him in favour of the petitioner to discharge such liabilities was bounced, upon which the petitioner had sent Anx. 1 demand notice dated 22. 9. 2018 demanding return of the said money covered by the dishonoured cheque, to which the said Vamban had given Anx. II reply dated 8. 10. 208 threatening the petitioner that it is known that the petitioner had sexually abused the mother of the victim girl as well as the victim girl and that those aspects would be brought to light, etc. 4. It is pointed out that after issuance of Anx. II reply dated 8. 10. 2018, the mother of the child had given complaint to the Police on 26. 10. 2018, which has led to the institution of the instant crime, and that the impugned criminal proceedings are tainted by malicious and ulterior considerations and has been foisted only at the instance of the person, who has issued Anx. II notice in order to wreck vengeance on the petitioner. 5. Per contra, the learned Prosecutor would submit that the allegations raised against the petitioner are serious and that the truth or otherwise of the petitioner's allegations cannot be assessed at this point of time and on this basis, the learned Prosecutor opposes the grant of anticipatory bail. 6. After having heard both sides and taking into account the abovesaid facts of the case and other attendant circumstances dealt with herein above, this Court is of the considered view that the custodial interrogation may not be really warranted. However, it is necessary that the investigation process is duly completed with due co-operation of the petitioner. Accordingly, it is ordered that: The petitioner will surrender before the investigating officer for interrogation process two weeks from the date notified for receiving certified copy of this order and after the interrogation process is over, the investigating officer shall produce the petitioner before the jurisdictional Magistrate court concerned, who is dealing with the abovesaid crime and the petitioner may then submit application for grant of bail, advance copy of which shall be given to the learned Prosecutor and thereupon, the learned Magistrate will consider the said application for bail on the same day and will pass orders thereon after affording reasonable opportunity of being heard to the petitioner's counsel and the learned Prosecutor, on the same day. It is made clear that in case the petitioner does not surrender before the investigating officer concerned as directed herein above, then the direction issued herein above will stand automatically vacated. With these observations and directions, the above Bail Application stands finally disposed of. Sd/- sdk+ ALEXANDER THOMAS, JUDGE

NO. 171/2023 BY ALLOWING THE PETITION IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE AND EQUITY. THIS PETITION IS COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS DAY, THE COURT MADE THE FOLLOWING: CORAM: THE HON'BLE SMT. JUSTICE LALITHA KANNEGANTI ORAL ORDER Aggrieved by the order passed in Crl. Misc. No. 171/2023 dated 02. 02. 2024 by the Principal Judge, Family Court, Gadag, the petitioner/husband is before this Court. 2. The parties are referred to as husband and wife for the sake of convenience. 3. The wife had filed Crl. Misc. No. 171/2023 seeking maintenance of an amount of Rs. 30, 000/- per month and litigation expenses of an amount of Rs. 50, 000/-. It is the case of the wife that she has been ill-treated by the husband and his family members have abused and assaulted her. Out of the wedlock, she gave birth to one male child and due to ill health, the said child died. It is her case that the husband is running a Chicken shop and he is getting daily income of an amount of Rs. 15, 000/- to Rs. 20, 000/- and he is getting income of an amount of Rs. 5 to 8 Lakhs from his land. It is stated that the wife has no source of income and she is not in a position to maintain herself. 4. The trial Court has given a finding that the husband had neglected the wife, when it comes to the quantum of maintenance, the trial Court observed that the wife has claimed maintenance of an amount of Rs. 30, 000/- per month, which is exorbitant one and it is prima facie found that the cause of justice would be served if the wife is granted reasonable maintenance by keeping in mind the inflation and high cost of living. The trial Court observed that in the process of doing complete justice between the parties, the trial Court had granted an amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month. Aggrieved thereby, the husband is before this Court. 5. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner/husband submits that the amount that is granted by the trial Court is on the higher side and it is an ex-parte order and without any basis, such order is passed. He submits that the wife is not entitled for maintenance as she neglected the husband. As such, the order impugned is liable to be set aside. 6. Learned counsel appearing for the respondent/wife submits that the trial Court had granted only an amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month as maintenance and even that is also questioned by the husband. It is submitted that when the husband has received the notice from the Court, he had avoided intentionally and he is coming up before this Court with different stands and this petition is liable to be dismissed. 7. Having heard the learned counsels on either side, perused the entire material on record. The wife had claimed maintenance of an amount of Rs. 30, 000/- per month and litigation expenses of an amount of Rs. 50, 000/-. The trial Court had granted an amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month as maintenance and an amount of Rs. 10, 000/- as litigation expenses. With regard to the ground that is raised by the husband that it is an ex-parte order, why he has not appeared before the Court when he received the notices, no positive explanation is coming forth. Neither he has appeared before the Court nor he has filed his statement of assets and liabilities before this Court to show that he is not in a position to pay even an amount of Rs. 4, 000/- per month to the wife. In that view of the matter, this Court finds no reason to interfere with the order passed by the trial Court. Hence, the following: ORDER i. Accordingly, the revision petition is dismissed. ii. As per the order passed by this Court, Demand Draft is deposited by the petitioner before this Court and the respondent is at liberty to withdraw the amount. iii. All I. As. in this petition shall stand closed. Sd/- JUSTICE LALITHA KANNEGANTI

Polu Anil vs The State Of Telangana on 26 April, 2022. HON'BLE SRI JUSTICE K. SURENDER. CRIMINAL APPEAL No. 43 OF 2020 JUDGMENT: 1. The appellant filed this appeal questioning the conviction recorded under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and sentenced to undergo seven years simple imprisonment. However, the appellant was acquitted for the charges under Sections 354-A, 366-A of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO' Act). 2. Briefly stated, the case of the prosecution is that PW1 who is brother of the victim PW4 filed complaint Ex. P1 with the police stating that PW4 was missing and he suspected the appellant herein. According to prosecution case, the appellant took PW4 to a temple and tied gold 'pustela thadu' (sacred thread) around the neck of bride during marriage ceremony. Thereafter, PW4 and the appellant stayed at different places and nearly after ten days, the accused and PW4 were caught by the police. Thereafter, statement of PW4 was recorded by the Magistrate and the police. As per the statement given to the police and Magistrate under under section 164 CRPC marked as Ex. P4, PW4 stated that she was in love with the appellant and decided to marry him and went with the appellant on her own, taking one gold biscuit weighing six tulas. She told the appellant that they should elope and get married, accordingly, they went to Karimnagar in an auto and boarded a bus for Secunderabad and from Secunderabad they went to Thirupathi. Thereafter, they were caught by the police. On completion of investigation, the police filed charge sheet under Sections 366-A, 354 of Indian Penal Code and Section 12 of the POCSO Act, 2012. After the trial, the learned Sessions Judge found the appellant not guilty for the said charges, however, convicted the appellant under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code. 3. It is the specific case of PW4-victim that she was in love with the appellant and on her own she went with the appellant to Karimnagar and to Thirupathi where they got married and came back to Secunderabad. Neither in the statement made before the Court nor the statement made before the Magistrate under Ex. P4, did PW4 make any allegation of force against the appellant. Further, she stated during the chief-examination that accused did not make any sexual assault on her. 4. The learned Sessions Judge found that the girl was not a minor and the provisions of Section of POCSO Act did not attract. The trial Court also found that there was no allegation of any molestation for which reason, the trial Court found the appellant not guilty for the said offences. 5. Section 366 of Indian Penal Code reads as follows: "366. Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage, etc. --Whoever kidnaps or abducts any woman with intent that she may be compelled, or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled, to marry any person against her will, or in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, or knowing it to be likely that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; 1 [and whoever, by means of criminal intimidation as defined in this Code or of abuse of authority or any other method of compulsion, induces any woman to go from any place with intent that she may be, or knowing that it is likely that she will be, forced or seduced to illicit intercourse with another person shall also be punishable as aforesaid]. " 6. Question of kidnapping or abducting does not arise when the evidence itself discloses that PW4 had taken six tulas of gold and asked the appellant to come along with him and on her own they went to Thirupathi and came back. There is not even a whisper for any kind of force or compulsion under which PW4 went along with the appellant for all the 15 days. 7. Having found that PW4 was not a child, having acquitted the appellant for the offences under POCSO Act and also having found that there was no outraging of modesty of victim girl, the trial Court ought to have acquitted the appellant. 8. As seen from the evidence none of the ingredients of Section 366 of the Indian Penal Code are made out and for the said reason, the appellant is liable to be acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of Indian Penal Code and accordingly, acquitted. The appeal is allowed setting aside the conviction of the appellant under Section 366 of IPC. Since the appellant is already on bail, the bail bonds shall stand cancelled. As a sequel thereto, miscellaneous petitions, if any, pending, shall stands closed.

Mr. X- Juvenile vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 4 April, 2023
HON'BLE SANJAY KUMAR PACHORI, J.
1. Heard Sri Shivam Yadav, Advocate holding brief of Sri Rajesh Yadav, learned counsel for the revisionist, Sri Ghanshyam Kesarwani, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the material available on record. Despite service of notice upon opposite party No. 2, none appears on his behalf.
2. The Present Criminal Revision has been preferred by the revisionist through his mother under Section 102 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as "JJ Act, 2015") against the judgment dated 24. 9. 2022 passed by Special Judge (POCSO Act), Auraiya in Criminal Appeal No. 26 of 2022, whereby the appellate court has rejected the Criminal appeal and affirmed the order dated 29. 8. 2022 passed by Juvenile Justice Board, Auraiya. The Juvenile Justice Board has rejected the bail application of the revisionist, which has been filed by his natural guardian/mother, under Section 12 of "JJ Act, 2015" arising out of Case Crime No. 20 of 2022, under Sections 363, 366, 376, 504, 506 of the Indian Penal Code (in short "I. P. C. ") and Section 3/4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, Police Station- Bidhuna, District- Auraiya.
3. Learned counsel for the revisionist submits that the revisionist is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case due to ulterior motive. The revisionist was 15 years, 1 month and 6 days old at the time of the incident. As per educational certificate, the Juvenile Justice Board declared the revisionist as juvenile vide order dated 29. 8. 2022 and no proceeding is pending against the aforesaid order. It is further submitted that the FIR has been lodged against the revisionist and three other named persons by father of the victim. It is further submitted that there is material contradictions in the statement of the victim recorded under Section 161 and 164 Cr. P. C. As per statement of the victim recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. , the victim has gone to the house of her friend in Kanpur and the father of the victim lodged false FIR against the revisionist. It is further submitted that as per educational certificate, victim was 14 years and 5 months old at the time of incident. As per medical report, no external or internal injury has been found on the person of the victim. Clothes have been changed due to which the clothes have not been collected during the investigation. The revisionist is in protective custody in an observation home since 25. 4. 2022.
4. It is further submitted that the finding recorded by the court below is against the social information report and is based on surmises and conjectures. It has been further submitted that there is no evidence to show that if the revisionist is released on bail, his release is likely to bring him into association with any known criminal, or expose him to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or that his release would defeat the ends of justice. No such findings were recorded as to how he will come in contact with known criminals and how he will be exposed to moral, physical, or psychological danger, or that his release would defeat the ends of justice.
5. Learned counsel for the revisionist further submits that the revisionist has no criminal antecedent to his credit except the present case and is not a previous convict nor is he associated with any kind of unsocial or criminal activities. There is no report regarding any previous criminal antecedents of the family of the revisionist. The natural guardian/mother of the revisionist has given an undertaking that if the revisionist is released on bail, she will keep him in her custody and look after him properly and has assured on behalf of the juvenile that she is ready to cooperate with the process of law and shall faithfully make the juvenile available before the court whenever required and is also ready to accept all the conditions which the Court may deem fit.
6. It has been further submitted that the Juvenile Justice Board as well as the Appellate Court have not appreciated the Social Information Report of the Probation Officer in its right perspective and passed the impugned judgment and order in a cursory manner without considering the position of law and have declined bail to the revisionist. The bare perusal of the impugned orders demonstrates that the same has been passed on flimsy grounds, which have occasioned a gross miscarriage of justice. The judgment and order passed by the learned court below are illegal, contrary to law, and is based on the erroneous assumption of facts and law.

[case 103]
The petitioner herein has been arrayed as the sole accused in the instant Crime No. 336/2019 of Kondotty Police Station, Malappuram, which has been registered for offences punishable under Secs. 354B of the IPC and Sec. 10, 9f & 9m of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act, 2012. The prosecution case in short is that the petitioner/accused aged 62 years is a teacher in the Madrassa, where the minor victim girl aged 9 years used to attend religious instruction classes and that on 26. 06. 2019 at about 9a. m. , the petitioner/accused had sexually abused the minor victim girl aged 9 years, while she is in Madrassa by kissing her face and hands and biting on her lips. In the FI Statement, minor victim girl has stated that on the day in question she was alone in the classroom and the petitioner had demanded her that she should come and sit on his lap and she refused and thereupon he had forced her to sit on his lap and kissed on her cheeks saying that she is his daughter and that he had bitten her lips and that he had lifted her churidar top and touched her stomach and tickled her, etc. and that thereby the petitioner had committed the abovesaid offences. Smt. Noorji Noushad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has fervently urged that the petitioner is innocent of the allegations and that he happens to be the innocent scapegoat in the factional fight between the two factions of Sunni viz. , AK faction and PK faction and that the petitioner is teaching in a Madrassa which belongs to one of the groups and that the petitioner has been victimized in the instant case, etc. Further the learned counsel for the petitioner would point out that though the incident is allegedly happened on 26. 06. 2019, the First Information Statement and the crime has been lodged only as late as on 06. 07. 2019 and the long and unexplained delay in the lodging of the crime will go to the root of the prosecution case as it affects the very credibility and believability. Per contra, Sri. Saigi Jacob Palatty, learned Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent-State would point out that the mother of the victim girl on coming to know about the incident which happened on 26. 06. 2019 had immediately complained to the President of the very same Madrassa, where the petitioner is teaching and that the police has now taken a statement from the said President of the Madrassa, who has stated that as a matter of fact the victim's mother had complained him on the very same day (26. 06. 2019) and that he had immediately authorized the Secretary of the Madrassa to conduct the internal enquiry in the matter. That the parents of the girl were patiently waiting for the action of the Madrassa authorities. That someone else who was interested in the welfare of the child had informed the matter to the childline authorities, which in turn led to the information being conveyed to the police, who in turn had taken the statement from the minor victim girl, which in turn has led to the registration of the instant crime and that the delay in this case cannot be said to be unexplained and serious and that in the light of the abovesaid facts and circumstances, the delay is satisfactorily explained, etc. Further that the petitioner has no case that the President of the Madrassa belongs to an opposite faction as the petitioner is teaching in the same Madrassa and the President of the Madrassa has given the above statement before the police about the information conveyed by the victim girl's mother on the same day itself. After hearing both sides and after careful evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the case, the following directions and orders are passed: (i) The petitioner will immediately surrender and personally appear before the Investigating Officer in relation to the instant crime, for interrogation purposes, without any further delay, at any rate by 9 a. m. on any day on or before 14. 08. 2019. (ii) The petitioner will fully co-operate with the Investigating Officer in the conduct of the above interrogation process. (iii) After completing the above interrogation process, the Investigating Officer will produce the petitioner before the jurisdictional Magistrate court concerned in relation to the instant crime, thereupon the learned Magistrate will consider and pass orders on the bail application of the petitioner on the same day of his production, after hearing the petitioner's counsel and the learned Public Prosecutor and after taking due note of the facts and circumstances of this case. With these observations and directions, the above Bail Application will stand disposed of.

[case 104]
Abdulla Ainulhaq Ansari vs The State Of Maharashtra And Anr on 16 December, 2021. This Appeal is directed against the judgment dated 10th October, 2019 in Special Case No. 211 of 2015. By the impugned judgment, the learned Addl. Sessions Judge & Special Judge, City Civil & Sessions Court, Borivali Division, Dindoshi, Mumbai has convicted the Appellant for offences under Section 376(2)(f) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 (n) r/w. Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and one of Rs. 5000/- I. d. rigorous imprisonment for 3 months for offence under Section 376(2)(f) of IPC; rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and fine of Rs. 5000/- i. d. simple imprisonment for 3 months for offence under Section 5(n) r/w. 6 of POCSO Act; and rigorous imprisonment for one year for offence under Section 506 of IPC. The Appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'the Accused') is the father of the prosecutrix (PW2). The prosecutrix along with her siblings, parents and grand parents was residing at Zore Chawl, Mahatma Kabir Road, Vile Parle, Mumbai. Some time in the year 2013, the prosecutrix was housed in Dongri Bal Sudhar Griha in connection with theft of a laptop. About a month later, the accused brought her home. Some days later, she ran away from home and was seen loitering at Kalyan Railway Station. She gave fake name to the police on duty at Kalyan Railway Station. She was produced before the Committee. She was sent to Bhivandi Bal Sudhar Griha (Children's Home) and four months later, she was shifted to Dongri Bal Sudhar Griha. In September, 2015, PW2 informed the Child Welfare Committee that the accused had subjected her to sexual abuse. Hence, by letter dated 08. 09. 2015, the Chairperson of the Child Welfare Committee directed the police to record the statement of the prosecutrix. Accordingly, PW5- Madhavi Kadav recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (PW2) pursuant to which FIR came to be registered against the Accused for offences under Section 376 (1)(ii), 506 of IPC and Section 6 of POCSO Act. PW5 referred the prosecutrix for medical examination, she conducted spot panchanama, arrested the accused and handed over further investigation to PW6- Sudhir Ghosalkar. PW6 requested the Magistrate to record the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. He also referred the accused for medical examination and recorded the statement of the other witnesses and filed the charge sheet upon completion of investigation. The Accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed to be tried. Prosecution in support of its case examined 6 witnesses. Statement of the accused was recorded under Section 313 of Cr. P. C. The defence of the accused was that of total denial. He has stated that the prosecutrix always used to run away from home. He objected to the same as he did not approve of the same. He claims that sometimes he used to beat her and hence she has lodged false complaint against him. The Accused has examined his wife as DW1. After evaluating the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the learned Judge has held that the evidence of the prosecutrix amply proves that the Accused herein had subjected her to rape. Hence, relying upon the sole testimony of the prosecutrix, the learned Judge held the Accused guilty of offence under section 376(ii)(f) of the IPC and section 5(n) of POCSO Act, 2012 and sentenced him as stated above. Being aggrieved by the conviction and sentence, the accused has preferred this Appeal under Section 374 of Cr. P. C. The evidence of PW2 reveals that she was housed in Bal Sudhar Griha for theft of a laptop. About a month later, the accused brought her home. She has deposed that the accused did not allow her to leave the house and used to beat her. She therefore ran away from the house, but the accused brought her back and assaulted her and cut her hair. The evidence of this witness is not reliable and trustworthy. She has not emerged as a truthful witness and has not passed the test of a 'sterling witness' and hence no conviction can be based on the uncorroborated testimony of PW2. The trial Court has based the conviction on conjectures and surmises, which are not well founded. Hence the impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Under the circumstances, the appeal is allowed. The impugned judgment is set aside. The accused is acquitted of offences under Section 376(2)(f) and 506 of Indian Penal Code and under Section 5 (n) r/w. Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). His bail bond stands discharged.

Sreesh P. T vs The State Of Kerala on 17 January, 2019. Bail Appl. .No. 244 of 2019. Crime No. 350/2018 of Thottipalam Police Station, Kozhikode. This application is filed under § 439 of the Cr. P. C. The applicant claims to be a teenager. He finds himself arrayed as the sole accused in Crime No. 350 of 2018 of the Thottilpalam Police Station. In the aforesaid case, he faces accusations of having committed offence punishable under Sections 354, 363 & 376 of the IPC and Section 7 r/w. Section 8 and Section 3 r/w. Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. According to the prosecution, on 8. 10. 2018, the police was alerted that a minor child was found in the house of the applicant under suspicious circumstances. They reached the spot and questioned the child. She disclosed about her whereabouts and on the strength of the said information, her mother was informed. Based on the statement of the mother, the Crime was initially registered under Sections 363 and 354 and the relevant provisions of the POCSO Act, 2012. On further questioning, she is alleged to have disclosed that she was in a relationship with the applicant herein and on an earlier occasion, she had gone to the house of the applicant near Semitherimukku and he had subjected her to penetrative sexual intercourse. Section 376 of the IPC and graver provisions of the POCSO Act were later incorporated. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant would contend that the applicant is innocent. According to the learned counsel, the applicant was just 19 years old when the offence was committed. The allegation of sexual abuse levelled against him is not true, submits the learned counsel. He is from a poor background, whereas the parents of the victim are affluent. He would finally submit that the applicant, a teenager, has been housed in a jail with hardened criminals for over three months and his association with such men would only aid in transforming him to a criminal. Heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who strenuously opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the applicant herein had escaped from the police custody and thereafter, he was re-arrested on 17. 10. 2018. Crime No. 361 of 2018 has also been registered inter alia under Sections 353 and 332 of the IPC as against the applicant. The learned Public Prosecutor would also contend that the allegations are extremely grave. However, it is fairly submitted that after completion of the investigation, final reports have already been laid in both the crimes. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the materials made available. Other than these two crimes, the applicant is not involved in any other crimes. Records would show that he has been in custody from 08. 10. 2018 itself. The final report has already been laid as well. In that view of the matter, I do not think that detaining the applicant for a further period would serve any purpose. By imposing appropriate conditions, for safeguarding the interest of the prosecution as well as the protection of the victim, the applicant can now be released. In the result, this application will stand allowed. The applicant shall be released on bail on his executing a bond for Rs. 1, 00, 000/-(Rupees One lakh only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the court having jurisdiction. The above order shall be subject to the following conditions: 1). The applicant shall appear before the Investigating Officer on all Saturdays between 10 a. m. and 1. 00 p. m. , for a period of 3 months. 2). He shall not enter the limits of Thottilpalam Police Station for a period of six months except for complying with the conditions of this order. If for any extraordinary reason the applicant requires to enter the limits, previous permission has to be obtained from the jurisdictional Court. 3). He shall not intimidate or attempt to influence the witnesses; nor shall he tamper with the evidence. He shall not contact the victim or her family members. 4). He shall not commit any offence while he is on bail. 5). He shall not leave India without the permission of the Court and if having passport, shall deposit the same before the Trial Court within a week; If release of the passport is required at a later period, he shall be at liberty to move appropriate application before the Court having jurisdiction. In case of violation of any of the above conditions, the jurisdictional Court shall be empowered to consider the application for cancellation, if any, and pass appropriate orders in accordance with the law.

She has stated that the father of her son is the present applicant. She was in affairs with the applicant and got married in one Temple. From the aforesaid wedlock, they have been blessed with a male child. 4. Learned AGA has stated that the present applicant has indicated his age as 20 years whereas the prosecutrix is a minor girl aged about 17 years as per her educational certificate, therefore, they got married without attaining the marriageable age. 5. The complainant, who is also present in the Court, has stated that since his daughter has got married with the applicant and from the aforesaid wedlock, she is having one male child, therefore, he has nothing to say. 6.

The applicant is having no prior criminal history of any kind whatsoever. Further, the applicant undertakes that if he is released on bail, he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall abide by all terms and conditions of the bail order and he shall look after his wife and child properly. 7. Without entering into merits of the issue; considering the arguments of learned counsel for the parties; contents and allegations of the FIR; the fact that the prosecutrix and the applicant got married in one Temple and from their wedlock, they are having a son of about four months; considering the statement of the complainant and undertaking of the applicant that he shall not misuse the liberty of bail and shall look after his wife and child properly, I find it appropriate to release the applicant on bail. 8. Accordingly, the bail application is allowed. 9. Let applicant- Deepanshu be released on bail in the aforesaid special sessions trial number on his furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions: (i) The applicant shall file an undertaking to the effect that he shall not seek any adjournment on the dates fixed for evidence when the witnesses are present in court.

HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD Case: - CRIMINAL MISC. BAIL APPLICATION No. - 47044 of 2020 Applicant: - Tilak Singh @ Debu Opposite Party: - State of U. P. and Another Counsel for Applicant: - Raju Kanaujia Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Rajeev Misra, J. Heard Mr. Raju Kanaujia, learned counsel for applicant, learned A. G. A. for State and perused the record. This application has been filed by the applicant Tilak Singh @ Debu seeking his enlargement on bail in Case Crime No. 409 of 2019, under Sections 363, 366, 376(1) I. P. C. & 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station- Gursahaiganj, District Kannauj during pendency of trial. Perusal of record shows that in respect of an occurrence which is alleged to have occurred on 8. 8. 2019, an F. I. R. dated 10. 8. 2019 was lodged by first informant Ganga Ram Fauji, which was registered as Case Crime No. 409 of 2019, under Sections 363, 366, 376(1) I. P. C. & 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station- Gursahaiganj, District Kannauj. In the aforesaid F. I. R. , applicant Tilak Singh @ Debu has been nominated as solitary named accused. As per prosecution story as unfolded in the F. I. R. , it is alleged that the daughter of the first informant has eloped with the applicant on account of his conduct. She has also taken away certain cash kept in the house of first informant. Learned counsel for applicant contends that the applicant and the prosecutrix are living together and from the cohabitation of the applicant and prosecutrix a child has been borne. Bail application has been supported by the affidavit of the prosecutrix herself. It is thus urged that present applicant is liable to be enlarged on bail. Per contra, the learned A. G. A. for the State has opposed the prayer for bail of the applicant, but could not dispute the aforesaid fact. Keeping in view the nature of the offence, evidence, complicity of the accused, submissions of the learned counsel for the parties, and without expressing any opinion on merits of the case, I am of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. Applicant is in jail since 18. 10. 2020. He has no criminal antecedents to his credit. There is no possibility of the applicant of fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the witnesses and, in case, the applicant is enlarged on bail, the applicant shall not misuse the liberty of bail. Let the applicant-Tilak Singh @ Debu be released on bail in the aforesaid case crime number on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the court concerned with the following conditions which are being imposed in the interest of justice: - (i) THE APPLICANT SHALL FILE AN UNDERTAKING TO THE EFFECT THAT HE/SHE SHALL NOT SEEK ANY ADJOURNMENT ON THE DATE FIXED FOR EVIDENCE WHEN THE WITNESSES ARE PRESENT IN COURT. IN CASE OF DEFAULT OF THIS CONDITION, IT SHALL BE OPEN FOR THE TRIAL COURT TO TREAT IT AS ABUSE OF LIBERTY OF BAIL AND PASS ORDERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW. (ii) THE APPLICANT SHALL REMAIN PRESENT BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT ON EACH DATE FIXED, EITHER PERSONALLY OR THROUGH HIS/HER COUNSEL. IN CASE OF HIS/HER ABSENCE, WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAUSE, THE TRIAL COURT MAY PROCEED AGAINST HIM/HER UNDER SECTION 229-A IPC. (iii) IN CASE, THE APPLICANT MISUSES THE LIBERTY OF BAIL DURING TRIAL AND IN ORDER TO SECURE HIS/HER PRESENCE PROCLAMATION UNDER SECTION 82 CR. P. C. , MAY BE ISSUED AND IF APPLICANT FAILS TO APPEAR BEFORE THE COURT ON THE DATE FIXED IN SUCH PROCLAMATION, THEN, THE TRIAL COURT SHALL INITIATE PROCEEDINGS AGAINST HIM/HER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW, UNDER SECTION 174-A IPC. (iv) THE APPLICANT SHALL REMAIN PRESENT, IN PERSON, BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT ON DATES FIXED FOR (1) OPENING OF THE CASE, (2) FRAMING OF CHARGE AND (3) RECORDING OF STATEMENT UNDER SECTION 313 CR. P. C. IF IN THE OPINION OF THE TRIAL COURT ABSENCE OF THE APPLICANT IS DELIBERATE OR WITHOUT SUFFICIENT CAUSE, THEN IT SHALL BE OPEN FOR THE TRIAL COURT TO TREAT SUCH DEFAULT AS ABUSE OF LIBERTY OF BAIL AND PROCEED AGAINST THE HIM/HER IN ACCORDANCE WITH LAW. (v) THE TRIAL COURT MAY MAKE ALL POSSIBLE EFFORTS/ENDEAVOUR AND TRY TO CONCLUDE THE TRIAL WITHIN A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER THE RELEASE OF THE APPLICANT. However, it is made clear that any wilful violation of above conditions by the applicant, shall have serious repercussion on his/her bail so granted by this court and the trial court is at liberty to cancel the bail, after recording the reasons for doing so, in the given case of any of the condition mentioned above.

[case 108]
Aggrieved by the order of learned Sessions Judge, Dhrangadhra in Sessions Case No. 24 of 2014 dated 8th April 2015, the present revision application has been preferred seeking to challenge the order of rejection of discharge application of the applicants-accused. It is the case of prosecution that the prosecutrix and her parents followed Islam. The marriage of prosecutrix with the original accused no. 7 and the applicant no. 1 herein was performed as per the Muslim Personal law and with the consent of the parties the Nikah had been performed. Under section 11 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ['POCSO' for short] so also under section 3 & 16 of the said Act and also under Section 376 read with 114 IPC, after the investigation, the chargesheet had been laid. It is the case of the applicants that Islam permits marriage at the age of 15 years, therefore, the limitation prescribed under the law for marriage of 18 years for the girl would not come in the way of the applicants. Moreover, the Court added Sections 4 & 17 of the POCSO which are the provisions prescribed for punishment under Section 3 and 16 respectively, that also has aggrieved the applicants. Learned advocate Mr. Malik appearing for all the applicants has urged that it is an internal dispute of the family which has brought to the fore the factum of child marriage. He has urged that the girl's statement also reveals that the paternal uncle of the girl since did not enjoy good relationship with the family, has complained against such marriage. He urged that the applicants are not only aggrieved by imposition of Section 4 & 17 of the POSCO but also for non grant of their application where they made a request for discharge from all the offences. He has fervently urged that the radiological report is clearly indicative of the fact that the prosecutrix is between 16 -18 years and therefore also, this Court requires to interfere with the order of discharge passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Dhrangadhra. Learned APP Ms. Punani has urged that the very object of the Act of 2012 is to protect the children who are not adequately protected, as they require security at the tender age. She urged that the age of prosecutrix was 13 years at the time of her so-called marriage, and therefore, the trial Court was right in not discharging the applicants-accused of the charges levelled against them. She further urged that Section 3 of the POSCO Act, 2012 speaks of penetrative sexual assault; Section 4 prescribes punishment for penetrative sexual assault and Section 16 likewise is with respect to abetment of an offence and section 17 prescribes punishment for abetment. Such additions, therefore, would not warrant any interference. Having thus heard both the sides, for the reasons to follow hereinafter, this application deserves dismissal. When there is sufficient ground existing for the Court to frame the charges on the basis of evidence that may be adduced by the prosecution by way of paper of chargesheet, the Court can frame the charges. Once the case is presented to the Court, it is required of the Court to sift through the material and it becomes its bounden duty to ensure that the reasonable ground is made out from such material for the Court to frame the charges. The law on the subject is well-settled. It is also reiterated recently, referring to all earlier laws by the Apex Court in case of L Krishna Reddy v. State by Station House Officer & Ors. , reported in (2014) 14 SCC 401. As could be noticed from the material on record, the birth date of the prosecutrix is 10th September 1999. The marriage according to the prosecution took place with the applicant no. 1 herein on 23rd August 2013 when the prosecutrix was only 13 years old. The trial Court has rightly observed that the victim being less than 15 years of age, the provisions of POSCO Act 2012 which are otherwise meant for protecting the abuse of the children have been rightly invoked, even if the parents were agreeable to such marriage, the law will take its own course. Moreover, addition of Sections 4 & 17 is merely incidental as substantive provisions of Sections 3 & 16 were already forming part of the chargesheet. On neither count, this application warrants interference at the hands of this Court. Moreover, there is no grave miscarriage of justice nor there is any manifest illegality which deserves indulgence. Resultantly, Criminal Misc. Application fails and the same is rejected.

[case 109]
K. Vijay vs The State on 29 November, 2022. This Criminal Original Petition has been preferred to call for the records in Spl. SC. No. 27 of 2020 on the file of the Principal District Judge cum Special Judge (Under POCSO Act) Puducherry and quash the same. The first petitioner is the sole accused in Crime No. 92 of 2019 on the file of the first respondent police. The second petitioner is the wife of the first petitioner. The Child Welfare Committee, Puducherry, has given the complaint to the first respondent that the first petitioner had committed sexual offences on the second petitioner. The said case came to be registered when the second petitioner who was conceived then, went to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital, Puducherry for medical check up. The second petitioner was married to the first petitioner as early as on 27. 04. 2019 and they started to live as a family at the first petitioner's house at Puducherry. When the second petitioner got pregnant, she was taking treatment at Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital, Puducherry. During the medical examination, she revealed her age that she was 16 years old and that prompted the Hospital authorities to pass information to the second respondent Child Welfare Committee and the second respondent, in turn, had given a complaint to the first respondent Police on the above allegation; and on which, FIR has been registered under Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 after investigation, final report was filed and the same has been taken on file in Spl. SC. No. 27 of 2020 for the offences under Section 361 IPC read with Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Section 9 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, on the file of the Principal District Judge cum Special Judge (Under POCSO Act) Puducherry. When the matter is taken up for hearing, both the petitioners present before this Court and filed their respective affidavits dated 10. 11. 2022 stating that the relationship between them is out of their marriage that had been taken place in the year 2019 and their marital life cannot be taken as a criminal offence. At no point of time, the second petitioner had intended to give any complaint against the first petitioner. Because she considers the first petitioner as her husband and for whom, she had delivered one female child. Now, the second petitioner is pregnant for her second child and the matter came to be known only when she had been to the hospital for her routine medical check up. Further, both the petitioners have also filed their respective affidavits dated 10. 11. 2022 stating that the continuation of the prosecution would only spoil their peaceful family life and also the future of their daughter. When enquired, both the petitioners submitted that they fell in love with each other and hence, they got married and their marital life is happy and peaceful. No useful purpose is going to be served by subjecting the first petitioner under trial. Even though the offence is non-compoundable, in the extraneous circumstances of the present case, I feel it is appropriate to rely on the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of PARBATBHAI AAHIR VS. STATE OF GUJARAT [AIR 2017 SC 4843] to quash the proceedings. In the said case, in Paragraph 15, it has held as under: 15. The Broad Principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be summarised in the following propositions: (i) Section 482 Cr. P. C preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inherent in the High Court. (ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and as a sequel, the further proceedings in Spl. SC. No. 27 of 2020 on the file of the learned Principal District Judge Cum Special Judge (Under POCSO Act) Puducherry is quashed.

V. Vishnubhaskar. .. Accused / vs The State - Rep. By on 16 November, 2017
This criminal appeal is against the conviction and sentence passed by the Mahila Judge, Coimbatore. The appellant / accused is convicted by the Trial Court for the offences punishable under Section 5 (l), (m), (n) and Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and sentenced to undergo life imprisonment and also to pay a fine of Rs. 5, 000/- and in default, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months. The case of the prosecution as could be discerned from the evidence is as follows: The defacto complainant Nithya (PW1) is the wife of the appellant / accused Vishnubhaskar. The PW1 and the appellant were living separated for the last two years and Nithya (PW1) had left her girl child aged 3 years and 9 months with her parents living in Coimbatore, as she was employed in Bangalore. The victim child was unwell on 07. 10. 2015 and since PW1 was in Bangalore and could not make it, she had requested her husband (Accused) who was living in Coimbatore at Maniyakaranpalayam, Ganapathy, Coimbatore, to take the child to the hospital. The child was reportedly taken to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital and admitted for treatment and subsequently discharged on 08. 10. 2015. Further on 17. 10. 2015 and subsequent days the child was taken out by her father (Accused) at the behest of Nithya (PW1), during which time he committed penetrative sexual assault on his own child under the guise of checking her private part for any insect. The child had symptoms of restlessness, sleeplessness, frequent urination and itchy sensation in her private part and it was on 23. 10. 2015, that the child narrated her ordeal to Meenakshi (PW2) and to Shakunthala (PW4) who are the sister-in-law and mother of PW1 respectively. PW1 was informed immediately and she rushed to Coimbatore and took the child to the Sri Ramakrishna Hospital on 24. 10. 2015 at about 05. 00 PM. Dr. Saranya Manickaraj (PW13) physically examined the child and her systemic examination report was marked as Ex. P14 in which it was mentioned as 'hymen intact' and no external injuries. Subsequently, the childline was informed by PW13 who in turn referred the child for psychological evaluation by “Vazikatti” a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). PW1 also lodged a complaint (Ex. P1) with the Sub-Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Coimbatore and the same was registered as First Information Report (FIR) in Crime No. 19/2015 by Tmt. Prema (PW14) Sub-Inspector of Police. Tmt. Rajeshwari (PW15) Inspector of Police referred the child for medical examination to the Government Hospital at Coimbatore on the same date. Dr. Sasikala (PW12) examined the child at about 10. 15 PM on 24. 10. 2015 and found the hymen absent. She also found the vagina mucosa pinkish in colour and an abrasion of 0. 5 cm on the right hand side of the private part of the child. A copy of Accident Register dated 24. 10. 2015 was marked as Ex. P13. Tmt. Rajeshwari (PW15) also recorded the statement of PW1 and PW4 on 24. 10. 2015 and on the next day i. e. on 25. 10. 2015, recorded the statements of PW2, PW5 & PW6 under Section 162 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thereafter, she arrested the accused, father of the victim child and prepared an observation Mahazar (Ex. P16) and also recorded the confession statement of the accused in the presence of Mohan Daniel (PW7) and Ramkumar (PW9). Tmt. Priyamalini (PW16) the Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Coimbatore who resumed duty after leave, took up the investigation and examined the child again on 26. 10. 2015. She also examined PW2 and took the child to the Judicial Magistrate III, Coimbatore for recording her statement under Section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code.

Mohammed Abdul Hamid vs The State Rep. By on 2 December, 2022. IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED: 02. 12. 2022. CORAM: THE HONOURABLE MS JUSTICE R. N. MANJULA. Crl. O. P. No. 29641 of 2022 Mohammed Abdul Hamid. .. Petitioner Vs. 1. The State rep. by Inspector of Police, T-14 Mangadu Police, Chennai – 600 056. (Crime No. 76 of 2021) 2. Salim. .. Respondents Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code, to call for the records in Crime No. 76 of 2021 on the file of the 1st respondent and quash the same. For Petitioners: Mr. K. Thenrajan For 1st Respondent: Mr. E. Raj Thilak Additional Public Prosecutor ORDER This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to call for the records in Crime No. 76 of 2021 on the file of the 1st respondent and quash the same. On the complaint given by the 2nd respondent that his sister's daughter was missing from 12. 12. 2021, a case has been registered for girl missing in Crime No. 76 of 2021 on the file of the T-14 Mangadu Police Station, Chennai 600 056 and subsequently the charges have been altered from girl missing to Sections 6 r/w 5J (ii) (i) POCSO Act, 2012. Today when the matter is taken up for hearing, it is submitted that the petitioner had married the victim girl as per Muslim rites and customs and the couple has a three months old infant born out of their marriage. It is further submitted that the de facto complainant who is the paternal uncle of the victim girl has also filed an affidavit by stating that in view of the marriage between the victim and the petitioner, he does not want to pursue the case. The petitioner, the defacto complainant, the victim girl and her mother were present before this Court and they were identified by the Police viz. , Ms. K. Gracy, SSI, SRMC All Women Police Station, Mangadu. The 2nd respondent has produced the copy of the Aadhar Card. A joint compromise memo, dated 02. 12. 2022 has also been filed. The second respondent has stated that she affixed her signature without fear or coercion. The records would reveal that the date of birth of the victim girl is 03. 06. 2004 and she has attained majority. As it has been stated already, the marriage between the victim girl and the accused had taken place and they have constituted a family and become parents for a female child. In such circumstances, if the prosecution is allowed to continue, that will not serve any useful purpose and that will de-stabilize the family equilibrium of the petitioner and the victim. Even though the offences under POCSO Act are non-compoundable in nature, in the circumstances of the present case, I feel it is appropriate to take the cue from the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Parbatbhai Aahir Vs. State of Gujarat reported in AIR 2017 SC 4843. In the said case, in Paragraph 15, it has held as under: 15. The Broad Principles which emerge from the precedents on the subject, may be summarised in the following propositions: (i) Section 482 Cr. P. C preserves the inherent powers of the High Court to prevent an abuse of the process of any court or to secure the ends of justice. The provision does not confer new powers. It only recognises and preserves powers which inherent in the High Court. (ii) The invocation of the jurisdiction of the High Court to quash a first information report or a criminal proceeding on the ground that a settlement has been arrived at between the offender and the victim is not the same as the invocation of jurisdiction for the purpose of compounding an offence. While compounding an offence, the power of the court is governed by the provisions of Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The power to quash under Section 482 is attracted even if the offence is non-compoundable. The petitioner who had married the victim girl, if subjected to trial that would affect the interest of the victim girl herself. In order to serve the ends of justice, I feel it is appropriate to quash the criminal proceedings against the petitioner by invoking the powers of this Court under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition stands allowed and as a sequel, the further proceedings in Crime No. 76 of 2021 on the file of the 1strespondent, is quashed in terms of compromise. The terms of Joint Compromise Memo, dated 02. 12. 2022 shall form part of this Order.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF GUJARAT AT AHMEDABAD R/CRIMINAL MISC. APPLICATION NO. 10266 of 2021 PRAKASHBHAI GORDHANBHAI METAL (KODI PATEL) Versus STATE OF GUJARAT Appearance: A R KADRI(7330) for the Applicant(s) No. 1 MR PRANAV TRIVEDI APP(2) for the Respondent(s) No. 1 CORAM: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. H. VORA Date: 22/06/2021 ORAL ORDER Rule. Learned APP waives service of notice of rule for the respondent - State. 1. Heard learned advocate for the applicant and learned APP for the respondent State. 2. This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for regular bail in connection with F. I. R. registered at C. R. No. 11215029200377 of 2020 with Tarapur Police Station for the offences punishable under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of the IPC and u/s 4, 6 and 18 of the POCSO Act. 3. Learned advocate for the applicant has submitted that the applicant and the prosecutrix were in love with each other and the prosecutrix accompanied the applicant of her own and thereby, abandoned the guardianship of her parents voluntarily. 4. Learned APP, while opposing the application, has submitted that at the relevant time, the prosecutrix was aged 17 years and 07 months. She being the minor, the question of consent does not arise and therefore, the offence u/s 376 read with POCSO Act has been committed and therefore, the applicant may not be enlarged on bail. 5. Heard learned advocates appearing for the respective parties in great detail and perused the records. 6. Though the applicant is married having one child fell in love with the victim girl. As the prosecutrix was minor, the applicant is sent behind prison because of the complaint lodged by the complainant. Undoubtedly, a minor girl is to be protected under law as there are number of instances of sexual abuses of minor girls and therefore, there is a special legislation of POCSO in the year 2012 and amendment in sections 375 and 376 of the IPC in 2014. The judiciary takes a very serious note of sexual offences against women and specially against minor girls. Upon reading of the statement of the prosecutrix, they both eloped. Further, the trial Court rejected bail application mainly on the ground that the girl is minor and her consent is immaterial. 7. In the present case, the prosecutrix is 17 years and 07 months old and the accused is 21 years old. It appears from the record and the statement of the prosecutrix that the prosecutrix was in love with the applicant and left the home of her own and moved with the applicant at various places. These are the mitigating factors and therefore, present application deserves consideration. 8. Hence, the application is allowed and the applicant is ordered to be released on bail in connection with C. R. No. 11215029200377 of 2020 with Tarapur Police Station, on executing a bond of Rs. 10, 000/-(Rupees Ten Thousand only) with one surety of the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court and subject to the conditions that the applicant shall; [a] not take undue advantage of liberty or misuse liberty; [b] not act in a manner injurious to the interest of the prosecution; [c] not leave the territory of India without prior permission of the Sessions Judge concerned; [d] appear before the Investigation Officer concerned, as and when required for investigation purpose and attend the Court concerned regularly. [e] furnish the present address of residence along with the proof to the I. O. concerned and also to the Court at the time of execution of the bond and shall not change the residence without prior permission of Sessions Court concerned; 9. The competent authority will release the applicant only if the applicant is not required in connection with any other offence for the time being. If breach of any of the above conditions is committed, the Sessions Judge concerned will be free to take appropriate action in the matter. Bail bond to be executed before the lower court having jurisdiction to try the case. It will be open for the concerned Court to delete, modify and/or relax any of the above conditions in accordance with law. At the trial, the trial court shall not be influenced by the observations of preliminary nature, qua the evidence at this stage, made by this Court while enlarging the applicant on bail. 10. Rule made absolute to the aforesaid extent. Direct service is permitted.

State vs. Ajit, on 29 July, 2017 IN THE COURT OF SH. SANJAY GARG, ADDITIONAL SESSIONS JUDGE­01, DWARKA COURTS, NEW DELHI. Sessions Case No. 440819/2016 State Vs. Ajit, S/o Sh. Uppender Kumar, R/o A­207, J. J. Colony, Manglapuri, Phase­II, Palam, New Delhi. FIR No. : 706/2015 Police Station: Palam Village Under Section: 354A/354D/324 IPC & 12 POCSO Act Date of presentation of charge sheet: 25. 04. 2016 Date on which judgment was reserved: 29. 07. 2017 Date on which judgment was pronounced: 29. 07. 2017 JUDGMENT: 1. The FIR was registered on the complaint lodged by the child victim. At that time, she was about 15 years old. In the complaint, the child victim alleged that the accused used to follow her, hurl vulgar abuses and make indecent gestures to her. She further alleged that on 08. 12. 2015 at about 8 a. m. , when she alongwith her friend was going to school, the accused caught hold of her hand and proposed her for marriage and upon her refusal, he caused injury on her left hand with a blade and thereafter, pushed her due to which, she fell down and sustained injuries on her head. Consequent upon the registration of FIR, the accused was arrested. The statements of the witnesses under Section 161 Cr. P. C. were recorded. The statement of the child victim was also got recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. After completion of investigation, the charge sheet was filed. 2. On 08. 07. 2016, the charge for the offences punishable under Sections 8/12 POCSO Act and Section 324 IPC was framed against the accused Ajit. He pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. 3. The prosecution examined the child victim, her friend, father and mother as PW1 to PW4 respectively. 4. Vide order of even date, the remaining prosecution evidence was closed and the statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr. P. C. was dispensed with. 5. I have heard the Addl. PP for the State and the counsel for the accused. The material on record has also been perused. 6. The child victim and her friend were the star witnesses of the case of the prosecution. The child victim appeared in the witness box as PW1. In her deposition, though she corroborated the incident to the extent that a boy had proposed her for marriage near her school and upon her refusal, he had pushed her resulting in head injury to her but she turned hostile on the aspect of identity of the accused. She was cross-examined by the Addl. PP. In her cross-examination, she denied the suggestion of the Addl. PP that the accused used to follow her and reiterated that he had not met her on the date of the incident. As per the case of the prosecution, the child victim was accompanied with her friend on the date of incident. The friend of the child victim was examined by the prosecution as PW2. In her testimony, she also failed to support the case of the prosecution and did not utter anything incriminating against the accused. Besides the child victim and her friend, the prosecution examined the father and mother of the child victim as PW3 and PW4 respectively. However even they did not support the case of the prosecution and denied the suggestion of the Addl. PP that the child victim had told them that the accused used to follow her and had sexually assaulted her and caused injuries to her on the date of incident. Since the material witnesses had not supported the case of the prosecution, it would have been a futile exercise to examine the remaining prosecution witnesses, who were formal in nature. The prosecution evidence was therefore closed. As no incriminating evidence came on record against the accused, his statement under Section 313 Cr. P. C. was dispensed with. 7. In the light of the above discussion, it is evident that the prosecution has miserably failed to bring home the guilt of the accused. Accordingly, the accused Ajit is acquitted of the charge for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 8/12 POCSO Act and Section 324 IPC. Bail bond in terms of Section 437A Cr. P. C. furnished on behalf of the accused has been accepted, which shall remain in force for a period of six months from today. Pronounced in the open court.

Vikas Soni vs State Of U. P. & Another on 5 August, 2021. HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD, LUCKNOW BENCH. Case: - CRIMINAL REVISION No. - 1461 of 2019. Revisionist: - Vikas Soni. Opposite Party: - State Of U. P. & Another. Counsel for Revisionist: - Akhilesh Kumar Pandey. Counsel for Opposite Party: - Govt. Advocate. Hon'ble Mrs. Saroj Yadav, J. This criminal revision has been preferred by the juvenile Vikas Soni through his father, under Section 102 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2015 against judgement and order dated 13. 9. 2019 passed by Special Judge, (POCSO Act), Pratapgarh in Criminal Appeal No. 51 of 2019 Vikas Soni Vs. State of U. P. and order dated 2. 7. 2019 passed by the learned Juvenile Justice Board, Pratapgarh in Bail Application No. 39 of 2019 arising out of Case Crime No. 31 of 2018 under Sections 41, 411, 413, 414, 401 of Indian Penal Code, Police Station Government Railway Police, Pratapgarh. The brief factual matrix necessary for disposal of this criminal revision are as under: On 10. 7. 2018, a First Information Report was registered at Crime No. 31 of 2018 at police Station G. R. P. , Pratapgarh under Sections 41, 411, 413, 414, 401 IPC on the basis of recovery memo prepared by Sub Inspector against the revisionist and three others. According to recovery memo, the revisionist alongwith three others was arrested on the information given by a fink at the railway station, Pratapgarh making preparation to commit theft. In search of the person of the revisionist, a mobile Samsung Phone of golden colour was recovered. He confessed that he has stolen the mobile from train 4-5 days back and trying to sell the same. It has also been mentioned in the recovery memo that he is a habitual thief and has committed thefts earlier also. Investigation started. Revisionist claimed juvenility and was so declared by the learned J. J. Board vide order dated 11. 6. 2019. His age was found 16 years. He moved bail application before the J. J. Board and the same was rejected. Against the order of JJ Board, an appeal was preferred under Section 101 of the Act of 2015, that too was rejected. Learned counsel for the revisionist submitted that the revisionist has falsely been implicated in the crime. The recovery has falsely been shown and there is no independent witness of the recovery. He further submitted that the revisionist was below 18 years of age on the date of the alleged crime. There is nothing adverse to the revisionist in the report of District Probation Officer. Learned A. G. A. on the other hand submitted that the revisionist is a habitual thief. Earlier also, he was detained and enlarged on bail for the offence of theft. Hence, judgment of the learned appellate court and the order of the learned J. J. Board are perfectly legal. The revision should be dismissed. Section 12(1) of the Act of 2015 lays down that when any person, who is apparently a child and is alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence, is apprehended or detained by the police or appears or brought before a Board, such person shall, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person, provided that such person shall not be so released if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring that person into association with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral, physical or psychological danger. The legal position is that, for a juvenile in conflict with law bail is the Rule. The bail to a juvenile can be denied exceptionally. From perusal of the record, it is discernible that the revisionist was arrested. The revisionist is in detention since 11. 7. 2018. He has spent more than three years in detention. Considering the above facts and circumstances, it appears just to set aside the orders passed by the learned J. J. Board and the judgement passed in appeal. The revision is allowed. The juvenile Vikas Soni shall be released on bail. It is pertinent to mention here, since the revisionist has now turned an adult, he shall be released upon furnishing a personal bond himself and two sureties each of the like amount.

Madras High Court Swetha Bhai vs State Rep By The Inspector Of Police on 4 November, 2022 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED: 04. 11. 2022 CORAM: THE HON'BLE Ms. JUSTICE R. N. MANJULA CRL. O. P. No. 26875 of 2022 and Crl. M. P. Nos. 16509 & 16547 of 2022 Swetha Bhai. .. Petitioner/A2 Versus State Rep by the Inspector of Police, W-17 All Women Police Station, Peravallur, Chennai 600 082. [Crime No. 05/2022]. .. Prayer: Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to call for the records in Spl. S. C. No. 122 of 2022 on the file of the Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases Under POCSO Act-2012, Chennai and quash the same. The petitioner is the mother of the victim child, who was also impleaded as an accused in the case registered by the Respondent/Police in Cr. No. 5/22 of W-17, All Women Police Station, for the offences under Sections 9(m)(n) r/w10 of POCSO Act & 21(1) of POCSO Act, 2012. Heard the submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent police and perused the materials available on record. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the complaint was given by a CWC Member by name N. Lalitha; the allegation made in the complaint is that the victim child appeared disturbed at her school due to sexual abuse caused by her own father; she revealed the said facts to her teacher; on coming to know this, the Head Master of her School called the Child Help Line and thereafter the CWC members met the child, enquired her and filed this complaint; so far as the allegation against the petitioner is concerned, she did not report the occurrence to the police despite she had knowledge about the sexual abuse caused by her husband on her child. The learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the first respondent police submitted that despite the mother had the knowledge about the occurrence, she did not come forward to give a complaint and only because of that she had been impleaded as an accused. Since the defacto complainant has just set the law in motion and she is not the victim in this case, I feel it is sufficient to hear the learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent police on behalf of the State. The records would show that the mother has been impleaded as an accused in this case on the allegation that she did not report the sexual abuse caused to her own daughter, to the police. It is a sad case where the perpetrator happened to be the very father of the minor child. In this difficult situation, it is not easy for both the victim and her mother to take decision about the appropriate legal action against the accused, who stand in a very close relationship with them. Even according to the complaint the mother of the victim had enquired about this to her husband during February 2022. Though allegations were made that the child had informed the occurrence to her mother during February 2017, the 164 statement of the child would show that she had informed her mother only during February 2022. As stated already, due to the difficult and intimate relationship of the victim and the petitioner with the accused, it can not be inferred that the petitioner had an intention to suppress the occurrence. It is needless to state that in sexual offences, the complaint can be given with some delay. And that may be due to social stigma and familial integrity and all other associated. Though such kind of occurrence should be reported immediately, if the perpetrator happens to be the father of the victim child, the mother cannot be expected to give a complaint without making thorough enquiry and ascertaining the facts from every angle and that may take some time. The gap between the time when the victim informed her mother and the date of the complaint made by the CWC Member is not too long. Hence, I feel the petitioner deserves to be given with the benefit of doubt even at the threshold level without subjected to futher process. In the result, the Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the FIR in Cr. No. 5/22 of W-17, All Women Police Station against the petitioner / A2 alone is quashed.

[case 117]
Muthu Kumar vs The State on 31 January, 2025. This Criminal Appeal arises out of the judgment of conviction and sentence rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POSCO Act, Chennai, in Spl. S. C. No. 195 of 2022, dated 31. 10. 2023. The appellant was tried along with one Bhuvaneswari (A2), the mother of the victim girl. The learned trial Judge found A2 guilty for the offence under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21(1) of the POCSO Act and convicted and sentenced her to undergo imprisonment for four months, and the period of detention already undergone has been set off under Section 428 Cr. P. C. The victim, P. W. 2, who was born on 15. 09. 2004, was a minor at the time of the incident. She had been living with her mother (A2) since her father separated from the family, taking the victim's brother with him. The appellant, an auto driver, came into contact with the victim's family when he began providing transportation. Later, he informed the victim's mother that he had divorced his wife, and the appellant and A2 began living together with the victim girl. Taking advantage of the mother's absence, the appellant forcibly committed penetrative sexual assault on the victim girl. This abuse continued, and the victim later became pregnant. She gave birth to a male child at home, and when complications arose with the umbilical cord, the victim sought medical treatment. This led to the involvement of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the Police, bringing the crime to light. Following medical treatment, the Primary Health Centre staff, Nammalwarpet reported the case to the CWC after discovering the victim's pregnancy and minor status. The CWC informed the Police, and thereafter, the case was registered in Crime No. 11 of 2022 against the accused for the offences under Sections 5(j)(ii), 6 and 17 of the POCSO Act. During the investigation, the victim's statement was recorded. Subsequently, the victim was produced before a doctor and a Magistrate, where her statement under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. was recorded. After recording statements from the witnesses and collecting the materials, the accused were arrested. A charge sheet was filed before the trial Court, listing 14 witnesses. Upon completion of the trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant (A1) under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The second accused (A2) was convicted under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21 (1) of the POCSO Act. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the trial Court's finding is contrary to both the law and the weight of the evidence. The learned counsel submits that the trial Court failed to properly consider the statement made by the victim, P. W. 2, who categorically stated that she and the appellant had got married, and that a male child was born out of their relationship. According to P. W. 2, she and the appellant were living together as husband and wife. P. W. 2 further stated that their baby developed an infection in the umbilical cord, and the baby was taken to the Public Health Centre for treatment. Additionally, the learned Government Advocate (Criminal side) submits that the de-facto complainant in this case is a member of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), who received information from the Public Health Centre in Nammalwarpet regarding the victim's condition. The trial Court correctly considered all the relevant materials and evidence in this case, including the victim's minor status, the DNA test report, and the statements recorded during the investigation. Based on this thorough and comprehensive analysis, the trial Court concluded that the appellant was guilty of the charges levelled against him. The victim hails from a marginalized background and lives in poverty. It is the appellant's family that takes care of the victim, supports her, and provides aid in all aspects. In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed; the conviction and sentences imposed on the appellant/A1 by judgment dated 31. 10. 2023, in Spl. S. C. No. 195 of 2022, by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POCSO Act, Chennai, is set aside and he is acquitted from all the charges.

There were matrimonial disputes and due to harassment, the 1st petitioner/1st accused left the matrimonial home and started residing in her parental home. Petitioners 2 and 3 are her father and brother respectively, who were accused nos. 2 and 3 in the subject Crl. M. C. No. 925 of 2024 2025: KER: 15509 -4- crime.

Accordingly, on 06. 07. 2021, at 2 p. m, the petitioners reached the matrimonial home, where she was cruelly manhandled by the present defacto complainant, her husband and neighbours. A case has been registered in respect of the incident as Crime no. 810/2021 (Annexure-VII). According to the learned Counsel, the instant crime bearing no. 811/2021 is a counter blast to the same. It was also pointed out that the allegations leveled in the F. I. S. are trivial in nature, as against the 1st accused. There is no allegation, whatsoever, as against accused nos. 2 and 3 (petitioners 2 and 3), except that they have not opposed the acts of the 1st petitioner/1st accused.

6. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal history of the applicant.

A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme Court passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. , 2022 INSC 690 and Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail.

(ii) The applicant shall remain present, in person, before the Trial Court on dates fixed for (1) opening of the case, (2) framing of charge and (3) recording of statement under Section 313 Cr. P. C. / 351BNSS If in the opinion of the Trial Court absence of the applicant is deliberate or without sufficient cause, then it shall be open for the Trial Court to treat such default as abuse of liberty of bail and proceed against him in accordance with law.
11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.
12. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

[case 120]
This Civil Revision Petition arise against the order passed by the learned I Additional Principal Judge, Family Court, at Chennai in IA No. 1 of 2023 in IDOP No. 1921 of 2023 dated 01. 12. 2023. The Civil Revision Petitioner is the husband. The wife presented IDOP No. 1921 of 2023 seeking for divorce under Section 10(1)(x) of the Indian Divorce Act. The petitioner married the respondent as per Christian rites and customs on 26. 06. 2013. From the wed-lock, a girl child was born to the couple. Thereafter disputes and differences arose between the parties. Alleging that the husband physically and verbally abused the wife and treated her with cruelty, the wife approached the All Women Police Station at Vepery. Finding that it was not fruitful, she presented the above original petition. Summons was served on the respondent, he has entered appearance. Pending the litigation, she took out an application invoking Section 36 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869. She sought for a direction to the husband to pay a sum of Rs. 30, 000/- to herself and her child and Rs. 25, 000/- towards maintenance. The husband filed a counter stating that the wife is a triple degree holder and she is working in an I. T. Company under the name and style of “Zoho”. He would plead that since she is earning a sum of Rs. 45, 000/- per month, she is not entitled to maintenance. Insofar as the litigation is concerned, he would state that the legal services authority is giving free legal aid to litigants and that the party could approach the said Authority for legal defence. Both the parties filed their affidavit of assets and liabilities as directed by the Supreme Court in Rajnesh v. Neha and another, reported in AIR 2021 (SC) 569. The learned Trial Judge came to a conclusion that the husband is earning around Rs. 26, 000/- per month and he is employed with CSS Corp Chennai as Technical Support. Therefore, she concluded that a sum of Rs. 12, 000/- i. e. , Rs. 6, 000/- each to the petitioner and the girl child would be reasonable in the circumstances. Challenging the said order, this revision arise. Mr. P. Sankara Narayanan, learned counsel would plead that the learned Trial Judge did not take into consideration that the wife is earning more than the husband and therefore, she is not entitled for any amount. He would plead that he would take care of the interest of the child, but cannot maintain the wife, on account of the fact that she is earning more than him and also to the fact that he is suffering from physical ailments and has to take care of the needs of his aged mother. Hence he would plead that the revision deserves admission and an interim order. I have carefully considered the submissions of Mr. Sankara Narayanan. At the outset I have to remind myself that the Court sitting under revision under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, would not normally interfere with the order of interim maintenance, unless and until the amount is arbitrary, excessive or bordering on luxury to the respondent. The amount granted to both the parties is only Rs. 12, 000/-. This works out to about Rs. 200/- per day. The parties are residence of Metropolitan City of Chennai. Therefore, the amount which has been awarded by the Court cannot be said to suffer from any of the aforesaid vices. Furthermore, the fact that the wife is earning does not mean she is disentitled to receive maintenance. In terms of Section 36 of the Indian Divorce Act, the wife is entitled to seek maintenance not only for herself but also for the child. The child is around eight years. Her financial demand will obviously be more than the paltry sum of Rs. 6, 000/- that has been fixed by the learned Trial Judge. It is not as if that the amount that is paid to the wife is going to be exclusively used by her. There is no dispute that the mother has the custody of the child and is attending to her day to day needs. Finding that the amount is not excessive, I am not inclined to interfere. The Civil Revision Petition is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is dismissed.

Chandru vs State Of Karnataka on 4 January, 2024 IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 4TH DAY OF JANUARY, 2024 The appellant was the sole accused in Sessions Case No. 40 of 2016 before the trial Court. For the purpose of convenience, the parties are referred to henceforth according to their ranks before the trial Court. The accused was tried in Sessions Case No. 40 of 2016 for the offences punishable under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act on the basis of the charge-sheet filed by Kolar Town Police in Crime No. 221 of 2015 of their Police Station. The case of the prosecution in brief is as follows: PW1 is the mother of PW2-victim. She was married to one Venkatesh of Channasandra, Bengaluru, and out of the said wedlock, the couple had two daughters i. e. the victim and CW3. Since three years prior to 17-12-2015, the accused was in illicit relationship with PW1. About two years back, he enticed PW1 with her two daughters and started residing with them at Karanjikatte of Kolar Town taking a house on rent from PW5-Papanna. PW2 and CW3 were aged about 14 and 8 years, respectively. They were studying in Kamala Mahadi Higher Primary School, Kolar. The accused was doing Masonry work and PW1 was working as Domestic help. The accused was addicted to alcohol. Due to his addiction to alcohol, PW1 was not giving him physical proximity. To appease his lust, the accused eyed on PW2. For that purpose, one day in March, 2015 at 1: 00 p. m. , he brought PW2 back home from the school representing that PW1 was unwell and committed penetrative sexual assault on her in the house and threatened her that if she reveals the incident to PW1 or CW3, he will kill all of them. Thereafter, he kept committing penetrative sexual assault frequently. Ultimately, PW2 became pregnant. When she became indisposable due to such conception, PW1 took her to SNR Hospital, Kolar. In the said hospital, PW11-Dr. Shanthi examined PW2 and found her nine months pregnant. On issuance of the MLC intimation, PW3-District Child Protection Officer visited the hospital and their enquiry revealed that the accused sexually abused PW2 and that she was eight months pregnant. PW13-Sunitha Devi, Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police, visited the hospital and recorded the statement of the victim as per Ex. P2 and submitted the report to PW14. Based on Ex.

Pending investigation, the victim delivered a female child on 11-1-2016. The trial Court on hearing the accused, framed the charges against him for the offences punishable under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act.

A NO. 437 OF 2020 SC 102/2015 OF THE ADDITIONAL SESSIONS COURT - I, KOTTAYAM PETITIONER/APPELLANT: THOMAS @ JOSHY, AGED 37 YEARS, S/O.

Application praying that in the circumstances stated therein the High Court be pleased to suspend the execution of the sentence imposed on the appellant in the judgment dated 18. 03. 2020 in S. C. No. 102/2015 of the Additional Sessions Judge-I, Kottayam pending disposal of this appeal and to grant bail to the petitioner/appellant. This Application coming on for orders upon perusing the application and upon hearing the arguments of GEORGE SEBASTIAN, SRI. BOBBY JOHN, Advocates for the petitioner and of the PUBLIC PROSECUTOR for the respondent, the court passed the following: ORDER Crl. M. A. No. 1/2020 This is an application filed to suspend the execution of sentence. The petitioner/appellant has been convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 377, 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i), 376(2)(j) and 376(2)(k), 376(2)(n) of IPC and Section 6 read with 5(l), 5(m) and 5(n) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act for short). He is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs. 30, 000/- for the offence punishable under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. Separate punishment is not ordered under Sections 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i), 376(2)(j) and 376(2)(k) and 376(2)(n) of IPC as provided in Section 42 of the POCSO Act. I have heard Sri. . George Sebastian, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Smt. Sheeba Thomas, the learned Public Prosecutor. The victim is none other than the daughter of the petitioner. The incident had taken place when the victim was only 10 months of age. The petitioner who should have been the protector of the child as a father, turned out to be a demon and sexually abused his own child. I went through the relevant portion of the judgment. Paragraph 12 of the judgment deals with the evidence of PW1 who is the mother of the victim and wife of the petitioner. She specifically deposed that the incident had taken place on 24/1/2015 and 25/1/2015. According to her, she saw traces of semen on the hip and corner of the mouth of the victim, who was only 7 months age at that time. She further deposed that on seeing this, she searched the accused and he was found lying naked on the bed. She further deposed that on the next day she witnessed the accused putting his sexual organ into the mouth of the victim and inserting his finger into her vagina. PW3 is the doctor. Ext. P2 is the wound certificate. Paragraph 24 of the judgment deals with the evidence of the doctor. The doctor deposed that she examined the victim and issued Ext. P2 wound certificate. According to the doctor, PW1 narrated the history of rape, oral sex and putting fingers into the vagina of the victim by the petitioner. The doctor further deposed that on examination, the hymen of the victim was found absent. I am not commenting on these evidence at this stage for the reason that it has to be considered at the time of final hearing. However, the fact remains that the court below believed the testimony of PW1 as well as PW3. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that there is seven days' delay in registering the FIR and no independent witnesses were examined. The learned counsel further submitted that there was marital dispute between the petitioner and PW1 and hence the evidence of PW1 could not have been relied on. I cannot rely on those submissions as such. Those contentions can be raised at the time of final hearing. Considering the heinous nature of crime committed by the petitioner, I am of the view that his sentence cannot be suspended. Accordingly, this application is dismissed.

Pocso Act vs In Re: Narayan Halder on 27 March, 2023. In Re: An application for bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed on 13. 02. 2023 in connection with Tehatta Police Station Case No. 451 of 2022 dated 04. 06. 2022 under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of the POCSO Act. Report is placed on record. From the report it appears a panel of three special Public Prosecutors have been notified for the Special Court under POCSO Act at Tehatta sub-division. In view of the aforesaid development, we expect that the trial will proceed with utmost expedition. We have considered the materials on record. There are materials implicating the petitioner in the offence of penetrative sexual assault. Under such circumstances, we are not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner at this stage. The application for bail is thus rejected. Trial court is directed to consider the issue of framing of charge at the earliest and in the event charge is framed, to take the proceeding to its logical conclusion keeping in mind the mandate under Section 35(2) of the POCSO Act. In a number of cases it has come to our notice that adequate number of special Public Prosecutors have not been appointed to the POCSO courts. Section 32 of the POCSO Act requires appointment of special Public Prosecutors who have adequate experience and sensitivity to handle cases of gender violence against minors in POCSO courts. Appointment of competent and efficient Public Prosecutors is a sine qua non for protection of victim interest and effective administration of justice in POCSO cases. In Alarming Rise in the Number of Reported Child Rape Incidents, In re1 the Apex Court held as follows: "8. There is a salutary reason for appointing Public Prosecutors exclusively for POCSO cases. Public Prosecutors must be trained to deal with child victims and child witnesses. They need to understand the psychology of children. They need to empathise with children. They need to know how to bring out the truth from children who are victims of sexual abuse and have to undergo the trauma again while recounting the traumatic experience. 9. The job assigned to the Public Prosecutor for POCSO cases is a very onerous one which must be carried out with great care and sensitivity. Therefore, not only is there a need to have exclusive Public Prosecutors but there is also a need to develop a training programme where these Special Public Prosecutors should be trained to deal with issues which will arise in their courts. These issues may not be confined to legal issues which otherwise Public Prosecutors may be trained to deal with. The issues may be psychological, health and other related issues. 10. Keeping in view these factors, we direct all the States who are present before us to take steps to appoint exclusive Public Prosecutors in all the courts which have been set up exclusively for POCSO cases. It may be relevant to note the expression 'Special Public Prosecutor' for every 'special court' does not bar the Government from notifying more than one special Public Prosecutor for a court in view of heavy pendency of cases in the file of each court. Reference in this regard may be made to Section 13(2) of General Clauses Act which reads as follows: "13. Gender and number. - *** *** *** (1) *** *** *** (2) words in the singular shall include the plural, and vice versa. " Paucity of adequate number of trained Special Prosecutors in POCSO courts requires to be immediately addressed. Legal Remembrancer is directed to submit report with regard to the following: (1) Number of Special Public Prosecutors appointed in each of the POCSO courts in the State of West Bengal; (2) Pendency of cases in each of the courts; (3) Breakup of cases in every court: (i) Where case is pending investigation; (ii) Where charge sheet has been filed; (iii) Where charges have been framed and/or trial has commenced. Let the matter appear on 31. 03. 2023. Report be filed on the adjourned day.

The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. 7. There is no criminal history of the applicant.

Kerala High Court Liju vs State Of Kerala on 3 April, 2019 Bail Appl. .No. 124 of 2019 CRIME NO. 1641/2018 OF Enathu Police Station, Pathanamthitta PETITIONER/S: LIJU, AGED 21 YEARS S/O RAJU, THENGAMOM MURI, THENGAMAM, ADOOR, PATHANAMTHITTA-691523. BY ADV. SRI. K. SHAJ RESPONDENT/S: 1 STATE OF KERALA, REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682031. 2 SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE, ENATHU POLICE STATION, PATHANAMTHITTA DISTRICT, KERALA-691523. OTHER PRESENT: SRI. C. N. PRABHAKARAN-SENIOR PUBLIC PROSECUTOR THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 03. 04. 2019, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Bail Appl. .No. 124 of 2019 ORDER Apprehending his arrest, petitioner seeks anticipatory bail under Sec. 438 of Cr. P. C. He is alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sec. 354 of IPC, Sec. 8 of the PoCSO Act and Sec. 75 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act ( JJ Act for short). The police of Enathu police station in Pathanamthitta district has registered a case as crime no. 1641/2018 against the petitioner. Prosecution case goes as follows: It all happened at around 1 p. m on 21. 12. 2018. The victim girl aged 16 years was returning from her school along with her friends. When they reached Karimpara junction, the petitioner who came on a scooter abused the girl. He caught her hand. When she objected, he slapped on her face twice. Heard Sri. K. Shaj, the learned counsel for the petitioner and Sri. C. N. Prabhakaran, the learned senior public prosecutor. It seems that Sec. 75 of the JJ Act is out of question. Sec. 75 provides punishment for cruelty to child. In order to attract Sec. 75, the offender must be a person who is in actual charge of or control over the victim child. The prosecution has no such case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that catching the hand or slapping on the face do not attract the penal provisions in Sec. 354 of IPC. It is also alleged that Sec. 8 of the PoCSO Act is not attracted inasmuch as the acts alleged against the petitioner do not fall within the ambit of the definition of sexual assault contained in Sec. 7 of the PoCSO Act. It is also the submission of the learned counsel that there is no allegation against the petitioner that he touched any parts of the body of the girl specifically referred to in Sec. 7. It is also his submission that catching the hand and slapping on the face cannot be termed as an act with sexual intent. It is too premature to have a positive or negative finding on the arguments of the learned counsel. But his arguments cannot be totally ignored or brushed aside. I do not consider the present case to be one where custodial interrogation of the petitioner is an absolute must for an effective investigation of the case. Considering all these matters, I am inclined to grant him bail. The application is allowed. If arrested in connection with crime no. 1641/2018 of Enathu police station, the petitioner shall be released on bail, after interrogation, on his executing a bond for Rs 75, 000/- (seventy five thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the investigating officer. The petitioner shall co-operate with the investigation. He shall make himself available for interrogation if so required by the investigating officer. He shall report to the investigating officer between 10 am and 11 am on every Saturday for a period of three months or till the filing of the final report, whichever is earlier. The petitioner shall not intimidate or try to influence witnesses. He shall not destroy or tamper with evidence. The court having jurisdiction is hereby empowered to cancel the bail in accordance with law if any of the conditions mentioned above is violated. If the petitioner surrenders before the court concerned, this order will cease to have effect and the said court will pass appropriate orders as if this order has not been passed. A. M.

ERNAKULAM IN S. C NO. 698/2019 OF ADDITIONAL DISTRICT & SESSIONS
(POCSO)COURT, ERNAKULAM
PETITIONER/ACCUSED:
BY ADV. SRI. T. M. SUDHEER
RESPONDENTS/STATE & COMPLAINANT:
STATE OF KERALA
REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR,
HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM-682 031.
THIS CRIMINAL MISC. CASE HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 29. 12. 2020, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: Crl. MC. No. 5644 OF 2020(E)
Dated this the 29th day of December 2020
The petitioner is the accused in SC. No. 698/2019 before the Additional District and Sessions (POCSO) Court, Ernakulam. The accused is alleged to have committed offences under Section 376(2) of Indian Penal Code read with Section 6 and 5J(ii) of the POCSO Act, 2012. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the petitioner that petitioner and the 2nd respondent - the victim, were in love with each other and in their relationship, a child was even born. Photograph of the child along with the petitioner and the 2nd respondent is produced as Ann: A6. It is also pleaded that the crime No. 342/2019 was registered on the basis of some misunderstanding and that, subsequent to the birth of the child, petitioner as well as the 2nd respondent have married each other. True copy of the marriage certificate issued by the marriage officer, Njarackal is produced as Ann: A4 and the birth certificate of the child is produced as Ann: A5. The prosecution alleges that on 26. 1. 2019, at 11. 00 a. m, the petitioner committed rape on the victim and the victim became pregnant. The crime was registered on the basis of a complaint by the victim. According to the petitioner, the victim and the petitioner were involved in a romantic relationship and have even married. The complaint was filed on a total misunderstanding and no proper investigation was also carried out. It is contended that continuance of the proceedings is a sheer abuse of the process of Court and no purpose will be served other than waste of judicial time. Petitioner is only aged 25 years and taking into consideration the gravity of the offences alleged as well as the subsequent developments, especially the marriage between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent and the settlement arrived at there is no purpose in continuing the case. The settlement is reflected through Ann: A3 affidavit, wherein the victim as well as her parents have sworn to an affidavit, stating that they have no complaints or allegations against the petitioner and they have come into to good terms with each other and also that no purpose would be served in continuing the criminal proceedings. The learned Public Prosecutor on instructions, submits that the Police have taken the statement of the victim and have verified the veracity of the affidavit produced before this Court as Ann: A3. According to the learned prosecutor, the affidavit is genuine and can be acted upon. In view of the above circumstances, continuance of the proceedings in SC No. 698/2019 before the Sessions Court, Ernakulam will only be an abuse of the process of Court. Since the matter has been settled by the parties and the petitioner has admittedly married the alleged victim, no evidence will be forthcoming to support the prosecution case. Continuance of the prosecution is therefore an abuse of process of Court and serves no purpose. In the result, the Crl. MC is allowed. Proceedings in SC. No. 698/2019 on the files of the Additional District and Sessions (POCSO) Court, Ernakulam initiated as per Annexure A2 is quashed.

4. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 359 of 2023, under Sections 363, 366, 376 I. P. C. and 3/4 POCSO Act, Police Station- Bidhuna, District- Auraiya, during the pendency of trial.
5. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. The victim is a consenting party as is but evident from her statement recorded U/s 164 Cr. P. C.

6. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal antecedent of the applicant.

8. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others AIR 1980 SC 785, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence and elaborate documentation of the merits of the case as no party should have the impression that his case has been prejudiced. A prima facie satisfaction of case is needed but it is not the same as an exhaustive exploration of the merits in the order itself.
9. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law of the Supreme Court passed in Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation and Ors. , 2022 INSC 690 and Manish Sisodia vs. Directorate of Enforcement, 2024 INSC 595 and without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail.

11. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail.

[case 131]
This is an application for bail moved on behalf of the accused-applicant, Sunil Nisad, who is involved in Case Crime No. 145 of 2020, under Section 376A-B IPC and Section 5/6 of POCSO Act, police station Kotwali, district Hamirpur. Heard learned counsel for the applicant and learned Additional Government Advocate and perused the record of the case. In short compass the facts of the case as unfolded by the prosecution is that Smt. Kusuma, informant, who is mother of the victim has lodged the first information report on 11. 7. 2020 in respect of the incident, which took place on 5. 7. 2020 at 12. 30 in the night against the applicant, Sunil Nishad (driver of the truck) for the offence under Sections 354 IPC and Section 8 POCSO Act at police station Kotwali Nagar, district Hameerpur to the effect that when the daughter of the informant was sleeping outside her house along with her siblings, the applicant came there and started doing indecent act and lied next to her and when the victim objected and called her father, the applicant ran away from the spot. Learned counsel for the applicant submits that applicant is innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case with some ulterior motive. Learned counsel for the applicant submitted that there is inconsistency in the prosecution version as well as in the statements of the victim recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr. P. C. The applicant is languishing in jail since 13. 11. 2020 and in case he is released on bail, he will not misuse the liberty of bail and cooperate with the trial. Per contra, learned Additional Government Advocate has opposed the prayer for bail and submitted that the victim aged about ten years has fully supported the prosecution version in her statements recorded under Sections 161 and 164 Cr. P. C. and clearly stated that the applicant inserted his fingers in the private part of the victim and has done indecent act with her. Learned A. G. A. also stated that the mother of the victim would not concoct a false story for implicating any one in such matter as the dignity and future of an innocent girl is also at stake. He also submitted that considering the gravity of the offence, no leniency should be given to the applicant as the crime is not only against the small girl/victim, it is against the society as a whole. In this case a small innocent girl has been raped who does not understand its meaning. Little girls are worshiped in our country, but the cases of pedophilia are increasing. Rape is a heinous crime. The victim suffers from psychological effects of embarrassment, disgust, depression, guilt and even suicidal tendencies. Many cases go unreported. In almost rape cases, the victim was unwilling to report the name of the abuser. The families of the victim remain silent about the sexual offences in order to protect the family image. The victim/female small child experience sexual abuse once tend to be more vulnerable to abuse in adult life. Healing is slow and systematic. In such a situation, if the right decision is not taken from the Court at the right time, then the trust of a victim/common man will not be left in the judicial system. This is the time to strictly stop this kind of crime. If the applicant commits rape on a little girl under twelve years of age, according the provisions of Section 376A-B of Indian Penal Code, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than twenty years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, which means that the accused shall be in prison for the remainder of his natural life, and with fine or with death. Having considered the facts and circumstances of the case, nature of offence, the gravity involved therein and the manner in which the crime has been committed, no case for bail is made out. The application for bail is hereby rejected.

[case 133]
The petitioner apprehends arrest in Crime No. 904/2017 of Pavaratty Police Station, Thrissur District. This is a typical case where the warring parties to a matrimonial dispute, without thinking about the consequences, make false and unfounded allegations resulting in irreparable damage to the reputation even of their child. The petitioner is working as a Village Officer in Elavally Village Office. The petitioner and his wife are married for the last 16 years and two girl children were born out of their wedlock. The father in law of the petitioner, after his retirement from service, unnecessarily started intruding into the affairs of the petitioner and his family leading to difference of opinion between the petitioner and his father-in-law. Unfortunately, despite spending 16 years with his wife together, the wife of the petitioner supported her father and stood against the petitioner leading to strain their matrimonial relationship. The members of the petitioner's family as well as the members of the wife of the petitioner's family met in the house of the petitioner on 18. 07. 2018 to sort out the differences between the petitioner, his wife and father-in-law. Unfortunately they could not able to succeed in solving their problems. Thereafter, on 27. 07. 2017, the wife of the petitioner has filed a complaint before the Pavaratty Police alleging that the petitioner had sexually abused their 4 year old daughter. Based on the above complaint, the police registered the above crime against the petitioner alleging offences punishable under Sections 5(m), 5(n), 6, 7, 8 r/w. 9(1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The petitioner is being victimised by his wife to settle matter for which the daughter of the petitioner is unfortunately dragged into this by the wife of the petitioner. She did not realise the consequences of the petitioner being put behind bars on account of this false allegation. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the allegation levelled against him are false and no such incident was happened. It was also argued that there was an altercation between the petitioner and his wife and they were living separately due to difference of opinion and there was a settlement talk among the petitioner, his wife and father-in-law. But, it became futile. Therefore, in order to pressurize the petitioner to settle the matter, the 2nd female child was brought into this by stating that she was sexually assaulted by the petitioner. In the meanwhile, the matter was mediated by the Kerala High Court Mediation Centre and it was settled. It was also decided to quash the entire proceedings which was taken in this crime. In fact, even though the crime was registered on account of the strained relationship between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent, now the entire matter has been settled. Considering all these facts, I find that the crime was registered on account of the strained relationship between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent. Therefore, I find that it is unjust to keep the petitioner, who is none other the father of the victim behind the bars. Moreover, the matrimonial dispute between the petitioner and the 2nd respondent have also been settled. Under these circumstances, I am inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the petitioner on the following conditions: The petitioner shall surrender before the Special Court for POCSO cases, Thrissur on or before 07. 12. 2018 between 10. 00. a. m. and 11. 00. a. m. and after interrogation, he shall be released on bail on executing a bond for Rs. 50, 000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) with two solvent sureties each for the like sum to the satisfaction of the jurisdictional Judge. The petitioner shall appear before the Investigating Officer as and when requested.

[case 134]
Bilal Ansari vs State (Through Sho Ps Jyoti Nagar) on 14 January, 2025. The instant application under Section 482 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (hereafter 'BNSS') has been filed on behalf of the applicant seeking grant of anticipatory bail in case arising out of FIR bearing No. 218/2024 registered at Police Station Jyoti Nagar, Delhi for offence punishable under Sections 498A/406/34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereafter 'IPC') and Section 3/4 of Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961. Briefly stated, the facts of the present case are that the marriage between the complainant and the accused was solemnized on 25. 02. 2022, as per Muslim customs, at the Mohammadi Masjid Kardampuri, Delhi, with the dower fixed at Rs. 20, 000. The wedding reception was held on 05. 03. 2022 at Green Garden Farm House, Village Sabhapur, following which the complainant had retired to her in-laws' residence at New Seelampur, Delhi. At the time of the complainant's departure, her parents and relatives had given dowry items - including a Creta car, Bullet motorcycle, gold and silver jewellery, furniture, appliances, utensils, and a sum of ₹5, 25, 000 in cash - as per the demands made by her in-laws. Additionally, the complainant's family had performed all pre-marital ceremonies, such as engagement, Roka, Haldi, and the Nikah, as per the instructions of the in-laws, incurring significant expenses. After the marriage, the complainant had noticed a significant change in the behaviour of her in-laws. They had allegedly started taunting her over various issues, speaking harshly, and verbally abusing her family. On 25. 03. 2022, when the complainant had questioned her husband about this behaviour, he had abused her and, along with his parents and siblings, accused her father of providing insufficient dowry. They had demanded a Fortuner car instead of the Creta and had insulted her for being outspoken. This had escalated to physical violence, with her husband slapping her, followed by beatings from the other in-laws. Over the subsequent days, her in-laws' harassment intensified. Despite fulfilling her household responsibilities, the complainant had been subjected to nightly demands to cook at odd hours. On 25. 04. 2022, her in-laws had demanded an additional ₹25, 00, 000 from her father, threatening to divorce her if she failed to comply. When the complainant's parents had arranged ₹5, 00, 000 and handed it over to her father-in-law, the in-laws had assured them they would not harass her further. However, this promise had only lasted a few days before the abuse resumed. On the night of 20. 06. 2022, the in-laws had demanded the remaining ₹20, 00, 000 and, upon refusal, had physically assaulted the complainant. Her father-in-law had pushed her down the stairs, causing her significant injuries. Despite her injuries, her in-laws had falsely claimed to neighbors that the fall had been caused by a rat. By 01. 08. 2022, the complainant was allegedly moved out of her in-laws' house and left at her parents' residence. Her in-laws had retained all her belongings, including gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and essential documents such as her PAN card, Aadhaar card, and educational certificates. Despite multiple requests, these items had not been returned. While living with her parents, the complainant had given birth to a son on 22. 02. 2023 through a caesarean operation at K. G. Medical Center, Delhi. All the expenses had been borne by her parents. Despite being informed about the birth, her husband and in-laws had neither visited nor inquired about her or the child's well-being. Since 01. 08. 2022, the complainant had been living as a financial burden on her parents, with no support from her husband or in-laws. On the basis of these allegations, the present FIR was registered.

On an appraisal of the materials on record, the court below found that the accused is guilty of the offences punishable under Section 376(1) of the IPC, as it stood prior to Act 13 of 2013 and Section 3 read with Section 4 of the POCSO Act, convicted him for the said offences and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years and to pay a fine of Rs. 50, 000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year for the offence punishable under Section 376(1) of the IPC as it stood prior to the Act 13 of 2013. Separate sentence was not imposed on the accused for the offence punishable under the POCSO Act, in the light of Section 42 of the POCSO Act. As noted, the accused is aggrieved by his conviction and sentence. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties on either side and having perused the materials on record, the point falls for consideration is as to whether the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused under Section 376(1) of the IPC as it stood prior to Act 13 of 2013 and Section 3 read with Section 4 of the POCSO Act. It is seen that the accused was charged for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i) and 376(2)(n) of the IPC, as amended in terms of Act 13 of 2013. The court below noticed that Act 13 of 2013 came into force only with effect from 03. 02. 2013, and in so far as the prosecution does not have a case as to the specific dates on which the accused has allegedly committed sexual assaults on the victim girl, he cannot be charged for the said offences and it is on that premise that the court below found the accused guilty of the offence punishable under Section 376(1) of the IPC, as it stood prior to Act 13 of 2013. At the same time, the materials on record disclose that it is a case where the victim girl had been sexually assaulted by the accused. The court, however, is unable to find the extent of assault to which the victim girl was subjected to by the accused. I take this view for two reasons. There is absolutely no reason for the victim girl aged about 15 years to raise a false allegation against the accused in court.

Muthu Kumar vs The State on 31 January, 2025. This Criminal Appeal arises out of the judgment of conviction and sentence rendered by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POSCO Act, Chennai, in Spl. S. C. No. 195 of 2022, dated 31. 10. 2023. The appellant was tried along with one Bhuvaneswari (A2), the mother of the victim girl. The learned trial Judge found A2 guilty for the offence under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21(1) of the POCSO Act and convicted and sentenced her to undergo imprisonment for four months, and the period of detention already undergone has been set off under Section 428 Cr. P. C. The victim, P. W. 2, who was born on 15. 09. 2004, was a minor at the time of the incident. She had been living with her mother (A2) since her father separated from the family, taking the victim's brother with him. The appellant, an auto driver, came into contact with the victim's family when he began providing transportation. Later, he informed the victim's mother that he had divorced his wife, and the appellant and A2 began living together with the victim girl. Taking advantage of the mother's absence, the appellant forcibly committed penetrative sexual assault on the victim girl. This abuse continued, and the victim later became pregnant. She gave birth to a male child at home, and when complications arose with the umbilical cord, the victim sought medical treatment. This led to the involvement of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and the Police, bringing the crime to light. Following medical treatment, the Primary Health Centre staff, Nammalwarpet reported the case to the CWC after discovering the victim's pregnancy and minor status. The CWC informed the Police, and thereafter, the case was registered in Crime No. 11 of 2022 against the accused for the offences under Sections 5(j)(ii), 6 and 17 of the POCSO Act. During the investigation, the victim's statement was recorded. Subsequently, the victim was produced before a doctor and a Magistrate, where her statement under Section 164 of the Cr. P. C. was recorded. After recording statements from the witnesses and collecting the materials, the accused were arrested. A charge sheet was filed before the trial Court, listing 14 witnesses. Upon completion of the trial, the trial Court convicted the appellant (A1) under Section 6 of the POCSO Act. The second accused (A2) was convicted under Section 6 read with Section 17 @ 21 (1) of the POCSO Act. The learned counsel for the appellant contends that the trial Court's finding is contrary to both the law and the weight of the evidence. The learned counsel submits that the trial Court failed to properly consider the statement made by the victim, P. W. 2, who categorically stated that she and the appellant had got married, and that a male child was born out of their relationship. According to P. W. 2, she and the appellant were living together as husband and wife. P. W. 2 further stated that their baby developed an infection in the umbilical cord, and the baby was taken to the Public Health Centre for treatment. From there, information was sent to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), which, according to the learned counsel, did not conduct a proper enquiry and rushed into action by lodging a complaint. The victim hails from a marginalized background and lives in poverty. It is the appellant's family that takes care of the victim, supports her, and provides aid in all aspects. In the result, the criminal appeal is allowed; the conviction and sentences imposed on the appellant/A1 by judgment dated 31. 10. 2023, in Spl. S. C. No. 195 of 2022, by the learned Sessions Judge, Special Court for Exclusive Trial of Cases under the POCSO Act, Chennai, is set aside and he is acquitted from all the charges.

[case 138]
In compliance with the order dated 08. 10. 2021, the minor girl Juhi @ Tanishka Rahul Wadhave is brought before us at about 2. 30 p. m. We have interacted with said Juhi @ Tanishka alone in our chamber. She has expressed her willingness to go alongwith mother and she is not at all willing to go alongwith her father. In the order dated 08. 10. 2021 we have thoroughly discussed as to how the petitioner-natural mother of minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka had to run from pillar to post for getting interim custody of her minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka in the backdrop of registration of crime against father of Juhi @ Tanishka. So far as the health issue of minor girl Juhi @ Tanishka is concerned, in terms of order dated 08. 10. 2021, she was referred to the hospital name and style as Varad Medical Foundation Institute of Child Health, Aurangabad. Dr. S. M. Khandelwal has examined the girl and certified that she is in normal state of health at present. The said doctor has also opined that the girl needs to continue her antiepileptic drugs as advice. A report to that effect is submitted by the Superintendent of Vidhyadeep Anathalay/ Balgruha, Chawni, Aurangabad alongwith medical fitness certificate issued by Dr. S. M. Khandelwal. Even the Chairman of Child Welfare Committee, Aurangabad has submitted certain papers. However, the same may not be relevant for the present discussion and for the cause referred in the writ petition. Learned counsel for the petitioner has brought to our notice that the proceedings in the form of D-004 of 2015 are still pending before the Family Court, Aurangabad wherein the petitioner has filed an application for modification in the order below Exh. 1 and 152 dated 12. 4. 2019 and the said application is still pending. The petitioner also intends to file another application pointing out registration of crime against the father of Juhi @ Tanishka requesting the learned Judge of the Family Court to modify the earlier order. In the instant matter, we are disappointed by the rude and unwarranted approach of the Child Welfare Committee, the Presiding Officer of the (POCSO) Court and also the learned Judge of the Family Court. Even though the father of minor child came to be arrested in connection with the crime, wherein the allegations have been made by his own minor daughter Juhi @ Tanishka pertaining to the sexual abuses at his hands, even then no one has cared to pass any order taking into consideration the welfare of the child. The said girl is only 10/11 years of age. We have interacted with her in our chamber. We do not think that on account of certain tutoring she has made the allegations. However, we are not intending to observe anything about it since the said crime is still under investigation and it is for the criminal court to record findings on merits at the conclusion of trial. In the circumstances, it would be just and appropriate if the interim custody of minor child Juhi @ Tanishka Rahul Wadhave is given to the petitioner forthwith. Since the petition No. D-004 of 2015 is still pending before the Family Court at Aurangabad, the parties are at liberty to make appropriate submissions and it is for the learned Judge of the Family Court to pass final order keeping in mind the registration of crime against the father of the child so also after giving an opportunity of being heard to both the parties. Till then, we direct that the interim custody of the child Juhi @ Tanishka Rahul Wadhave shall be given to the petitioner with immediate effect. We also record our opinion that the explanation tendered by the leaned Judge of the POCSO Court is not at all satisfactory. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of.

Crl. M. A. 1075/2016 (Delay in filing) 1. This is an application under Section 5 of Limitation Act read with Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure filed by the State seeking condonation of delay of 7 days in filing the present leave to appeal petition. 2. Heard. For the reasons stated in the application, delay in filing the present leave to appeal petition is condoned. 3. Application stands disposed of. Crl. LP No. 44/2016 4. The present leave to appeal has been filed by the State under Section 378(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure being aggrieved by the impugned judgment dated 01. 10. 2015 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-01, North-East, Karkardooma, Delhi thereby acquitting the respondent. 5. The brief facts of the case as noticed by the learned Trial Court are as under: "The victim in this case is a girl aged about 7 years and a student of class 2nd at the time of incident. She was residing with her parents, grandparents and brother. She had alleged that on 15. 02. 2011, when she was going upstairs to her room at the top floor after purchasing milk from a shop, one boy namely Amit who used to do DJ work with her father and also known to her previously, met and caught hold of her at the second floor and removed her Pajami. She further alleged that when she asked the accused to leave her, he did not do so and instead sat on her waist and inserted his finger into her urinary organ on which she started crying and he also wetted her Pajami. Meanwhile, on hearing the cries of the victim, her mother reached there and on seeing her, accused Amit ran away. On the asking of her mother, the victim told the incident to her and thereafter to her father. On the complaint of the victim, a case was registered for the offences punishable under Sections 376/511 Indian Penal Code vide FIR No. 57/2011, dated 16. 02. 2011. The accused was arrested on the same day. " 6. After investigation was over, charge-sheet against the accused was filed before the Court for the offence under Section 376 (2) (f) of the Indian Penal Code and charge was framed against the accused for the said offence. To substantiate its accusation, prosecution examined thirteen witnesses in all to prove its case. Statement of accused under Section 313 of Code of Criminal Procedure was recorded wherein he pleaded his innocence and claimed to be tried. 7. The learned Trial Court, upon analysis, examination and evaluation of the prosecution evidence and after considering the rival submissions recorded acquittal against the accused for the charged offence but found him guilty for the offence punishable under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code and convicted him accordingly. 8. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment, the State has filed the present leave petition contending that the view and the ultimate conclusion recorded by the learned Trial Court in acquitting the accused for the offence under Section 376 (2) (f) of the Indian Penal Code is manifestly perverse, unsustainable, tainted with non-application of mind to vital evidence, a result of wrong interpretation of evidence of minor victim girl and other substantial evidences, which has resulted into miscarriage of justice.

CIVIL JUDGE AND JMFC, MUDHOL IN C. C. NO. 52/2023 AGAINST THE ACCUSED NO. 2 AND 3/PETITIONERS HEREIN. THIS PETITION, COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY, ORDER WAS MADE THEREIN AS UNDER: CORAM: THE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE HEMANT CHANDANGOUDAR THE PETITIONERS ARE FACING CHARGES UNDER SECTION 80 OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015 AND SECTION 34 OF THE INDIAN PENAL CODE (IPC) AND HAVE APPROACHED THIS COURT SEEKING APPROPRIATE RELIEF. THE PROSECUTION ALLEGES THAT ACCUSED NO. 1 GAVE BIRTH TO A FEMALE CHILD ON 14. 08. 2021, AND THE CHILD WAS GIVEN IN ADOPTION TO THE PETITIONERS ON 15. 08. 2021 WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE LEGAL PROCEDURE PRESCRIBED UNDER THE JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015. HEARD THE LEARNED COUNSEL FOR THE PETITIONERS, THE LEARNED HIGH COURT GOVERNMENT PLEADER FOR THE RESPONDENT-STATE, AND THE LEARNED COUNSEL APPEARING FOR RESPONDENT NO. 2. SECTION 80 OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015 PRESCRIBES PUNITIVE MEASURES FOR ILLEGAL ADOPTION. IT STATES: "IF ANY PERSON OR ORGANIZATION OFFERS, GIVES, OR RECEIVES ANY ORPHAN, ABANDONED, OR SURRENDERED CHILD FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADOPTION WITHOUT FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONS OR PROCEDURES AS PROVIDED IN THIS ACT, SUCH PERSON OR ORGANIZATION SHALL BE PUNISHABLE WITH IMPRISONMENT OF EITHER DESCRIPTION FOR A TERM WHICH MAY EXTEND UP TO THREE YEARS, OR WITH A FINE OF ONE LAKH RUPEES, OR WITH BOTH. " A PLAIN READING OF SECTION 80 ESTABLISHES THAT FOR AN ACT TO CONSTITUTE AN OFFENSE UNDER THIS PROVISION, THE CHILD IN QUESTION MUST BE AN ORPHAN, ABANDONED, OR SURRENDERED CHILD, AS DEFINED UNDER SECTIONS 2(1), 2(42), AND 2(60) OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) ACT, 2015. IN THE PRESENT CASE, THE CHILD IN QUESTION WAS THE BIOLOGICAL CHILD OF ACCUSED NO. 1 AND WAS GIVEN IN ADOPTION TO ACCUSED NOS. 2 AND 3. SINCE THE CHILD DOES NOT FALL UNDER THE LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF ORPHAN, ABANDONED, OR SURRENDERED CHILD, THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT TO CONSTITUTE AN OFFENSE UNDER SECTION 80 IS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT. WHEN THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENT OF SECTION 80 IS NOT SATISFIED, THE CONTINUATION OF CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE PETITIONERS WOULD AMOUNT TO AN ABUSE OF THE PROCESS OF LAW. ACCORDINGLY, I PASS THE FOLLOWING: ORDER i) THE CRIMINAL PETITION IS ALLOWED ii) THE IMPUGNED PROCEEDINGS IN C. C. NO. 52/2023, PENDING ON THE FILE OF THE PRINCIPAL CIVIL JUDGE AND JMFC, MUDHOL, INSOFAR IT RELATES TO THE PETITIONERS- ACCUSED HEREIN IS HEREBY QUASHED.

Separate sentence for offence punishable under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the IPC is not awarded. .. . The case of the prosecution is that the victim, aged 17 years on the day of the incident, was a student of standard XI. She was suffering from persistent head and body ache. The victim underwent various treatments and medications to no avail. She came to know about the accused, allegedly a quack, from her maternal aunt. She accompanied her mother to Sonsari to meet the accused who examined her and declared that the victim will have to be treated for three days. The victim and her mother stayed at the residence of the accused. On 24-1-2015 at 9-00 a. m. or thereabout the accused took the victim inside the house on the pretext of applying 'gandh' (sandalwood paste) and closed the door. The victim was asked to remove her clothes. The accused too removed his clothes and demanded sexual favour. The victim refused to oblige and attempted to raise an alarm. The accused threatened to kill her with an iron bar. The accused made the victim lie down on the floor and subjected her to forcible sexual intercourse. Since the victim did not come out of the room for a long period, her mother with the help of other villagers forcibly opened the door. The victim narrated to her mother that she was ravished. The victim and other villagers took the accused to Purada Police Station where the victim lodged report (Exhibit 6) on the basis of which offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 4 of the POCSO Act was registered against the accused. Investigation ensued, upon completion of which charge-sheet was submitted under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 4 of the POCSO Act in the Court of Sessions Judge, Gadchiroli. The learned Sessions Judge framed charge (Exhibit 3A) for offence punishable under Section 376 of the IPC and Section 4 of the POCSO Act. Additional charge for offence under Section 506 of the IPC was framed vide Exhibit 37. The accused abjured guilt and claimed to be tried and the defence is of total denial and false implication. The accused is convicted for the offence under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the IPC and Section 4 read with Section 17 of the POCSO Act. .. . The victim has deposed that she was subjected to forcible sexual intercourse. This evidence is not accepted by the learned Sessions Judge, and I see no reason to take a different view. The claim of the victim that she was subjected to forcible sexual intercourse is not corroborated by medical evidence.

Opposite Party: - State Of U. P. And 3 Others. Hon'ble Krishan Pahal, J. 1. None is present on behalf of the informant even in the revised call. 2. On telephonic conversation with the Investigating Officer, learned AGA has informed that the informant is out of station and the I. O. had telephonically informed him about the instant case on 15. 11. 2024, as such, service of notice is deemed sufficient. 3. Heard Sri Phool Singh Yadav, learned counsel for the applicant, Sri Sunil Kumar, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the material placed on record. 4. Applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 171 of 2022, under Sections 376(3), 328, 506 of I. P. C. and Sections 5j(ii), (5n)/6 of POCSO Act, during the pendency of trial. 5. Learned counsel for the applicant has argued that the applicant is absolutely innocent and has been falsely implicated in the present case. He has nothing to do with the said offence as alleged in the FIR. The FIR is delayed by about six months and there is no explanation of the said delay caused. 6. Learned counsel has further stated that the allegations levelled against the applicant are per se false. The DNA report, which has been filed as Annexure-2 to the supplementary affidavit dated 11. 11. 2024, indicates that the applicant is not the biological father of the child. 7. Several other submissions have been made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate the falsity of the allegations made against him. The circumstances which, as per counsel, led to the false implication of the applicant have also been touched upon at length. There is no criminal history of the applicant. The applicant is languishing in jail since 02. 09. 2022, as such, his fundamental rights stand violated as he is incarcerated for more than two years. 8. Per contra, learned A. G. A. has vehemently opposed the bail application on the ground that the reason of delay in institution of FIR is but obvious from the fact that the victim was found pregnant at an advanced stage at that time. 9. This Court had also fetched the report with regard to status of the trial from learned Trial Judge and as per the said report dated 25. 02. 2025, four witnesses have already been examined. 10. Learned counsel for the applicant has also stated that there is no likelihood of the applicant tampering with the evidence anymore. 11. In light of the judgement of the Supreme Court passed in Niranjan Singh and another vs Prabhakar Rajaram Kharote and others, this Court has avoided detailed examination of the evidence. 12. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, submissions made by learned counsel for the parties, the evidence on record, and taking into consideration the settled law, the Court is of the view that the applicant has made out a case for bail. The bail application is allowed. 13. Let the applicant be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties. 14. In case of breach of any of the above conditions, it shall be a ground for cancellation of bail. 15. It is made clear that observations made in granting bail to the applicant shall not in any way affect the learned trial Judge in forming his independent opinion based on the testimony of the witnesses.

As per the allegations in the FIR, co-accused Rambhawan and the present accused-applicant with their user IDs, kumarsonu191919@gamil. com, kumarsonu171819@gamil. com, kumarsonu181987@gamil. com and ajit18021987@yahoo. co. in respectively had shared and exchanged various Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) i. e. picture/videos depicting children in obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner between the period from January, 2015 and February, 2016 onwards. The present accused-applicant would ask for CSAM from co-accused Rambhawan. Accused-applicant had used several email accounts to transmit sexually explicit child abuse pictures, material, acts to several persons. This incriminating material would relate to child sexual abuse, photos, videos etc. which were recovered from the email accounts of the accused-applicant and were restored in his email accounts. On analysis and scrutiny of mobile phone data, incriminating material was recovered from the accused-applicant in the form of photographs and video clips (depicting Child in Sexually Explicit Manner) and various online social media platforms including Whatsapp and Telegram connected with the mobile phone numbers being used by the accused-applicant. The accused-applicant was in constant touch with other co-accused. Accused-applicant had met co-accused Ajay Kumar Gupta through Bluedapp (mobile app generally used by LGBT community) in the year 2019 while he was preparing for competitive exams at Patna, Bihar. The accused-applicant shared his feelings for performing sexual activities with minor kids to co-accused Ajay Kumar Gupta, resident of Sakaldiha, District Chandauli, Uttar Pradesh.

Considering the heinousness of offence, its gravity and the evidence available against the accused-applicant, this Court does not find any ground to enlarge the accused-applicant on bail. Bail application is accordingly rejected. Order Date: - 7. 2. 2023

P. and Another Counsel for Revisionist: - Jai Singh Yadav Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Dinesh Pathak, J. Heard learned counsel for the revisionist, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the record. Instant Criminal Revision has been preferred against the judgment and order dated 13. 07. 2020 passed by Speical Judge (POCSO Act), Court No. 1, Moradabad in Criminal Appeal No. 15 of 2020 (Kapil Vs. State of U. P. & Others) as well as order dated 28. 02. 2020 passed by Principal Magistrate, Juvenile Justice Board, Moradabad in case crime No. 421 of 2019 under section 323, 307, 504, 506, 34 I. P. C. , Police Station- Thakurdwara, District- Moradabad. Office report dated 17. 11. 2020, reveals that learned C. J. M. has submitted his report dated 02. 11. 2020 stating therein that notice is personally served upon the opposite party No. 2. Despite service of notice, no one has put in appearance on behalf of the opposite party No. 2. Therefore, matter is heard in his absence. As per F. I. R. version, on 08. 10. 2019 at about 10: 30 a. m. while the brother of informant went to the filed to sow Barseem (Grass), Naresh and others including the present applicant came on spot and started abusing to the brother of informant. While they have been restrained, Naresh has attacked at the brother of the informant with the spade. Apart from that Devendra, Kapil and Gajendra had beaten up and used abusive language. It is submitted that present revisionist is a child in conflict with law and he has been illegally implicated in the present matter for some ulterior motive. It is submitted that in the F. I. R. no specific role has been assigned to the present revisionist, by the prosecution, in the commission of crime except he has also abused to the informant and his brother, along with other accused. It is further submitted that witnesses namely Mahipaal, Jagroop and Vivek, who have made their statements under section 161 Cr. P. C. , have not taken the name of the present applicant showing his involvement in the commission of crime. It is further submitted that the remaining three accused namely Naresh, who is the person assigned role of using spade, Gajendra Yadav and Devendra have already been enlarged on bail by this Hon'ble Court. Per contra, learned A. G. A. has vehemently opposed this criminal revision and contended that his innocence cannot be adjudicated at pre trail stage, therefore, he does not deserve any indulgence and there is likelihood of his involvement in other case. In case he is released on bail, he may misuse the liberty of bail. Upon hearing learned counsel and perusal of record and considering the complicity of accused as well as totality of facts and circumstances, at this stage without commenting on the merits of the case, I find it a fit case for bail. Let the revisionist Kapil be released on bail in case crime no. 421 of 2019, under Sections 323, 307, 504, 506, 34 I. P. C. , Police Station- Thakurdwara, District- Moradabad, on furnishing a personal bond and two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of magistrate/court concerned.

This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of the code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, praying to enlarge the petitioners on bail in Crime No. 30/2016 of Bethamangala Police Station, Kolar Gold Fields, for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(F), 366(A), 506 read with 34 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Sections 5 and 6 of POCSO Act and Sections 3, 4, 5, 6 of Child Marriage Restraint Act and Section 3 (1) (10(11) of SC/ST (POA) Act.
This petition coming on for Orders this day, the court made the following:
Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Pleader.
2. It is stated that one Sumashree had lodged a complaint on 19. 12. 2015 alleging that on 2. 11. 2015 at 12 noon, accused no. 1 Narasimha Raju and others had kidnapped her from Devarahalli village, Bangarpet Taluk, in order that she be married to accused no. 1. Her marriage was accordingly solemnized with accused no. 1 on 5. 11. 2015 at Bethamangala by accused no. 3 Krishnamurthy and the parents of the complainant, accused no. 9 Shriramulu and accused no. 10 Munilakshmi and others. After the wedding, accused no. 1 had forcible sexual intercourse with the complainant. It transpires that on the pretext of taking them to Police Station at Bethamangala, accused no. 5 Nallur Narayanaswamy had taken them to Devarahalli. On 9. 11. 2015, accused no. 3, it is alleged had kidnapped them from Devarahalli village and kept them in an unknown place and on 10. 11. 2015, when they came near Rajapet Road, accused no. 4 Meenakshi, sister of accused no. 1 had accosted them and abused them in foul language. And on 12. 11. 2015, Nallur Narayanaswamy, Venkataramaiah, Sanda Muniswamy and Manu took the victim and handed over to her parents and thereafter the complainant had lodged a complaint.
3. The allegations are vague. The accusation of the complainant having been kidnapped and having been subjected to forcible sexual intercourse is lost in continuous narration of the sequence of events. Therefore, the petitioner has made out a case for grant of bail, especially since accused nos. 2 and 3 have already been enlarged on bail.
Therefore, the petition is allowed. The petitioner shall be enlarged on bail on his furnishing a self bond in a sum of Rs. 25, 000/- with a surety for a likesum to the satisfaction of the trial court, subject to following conditions:
(i) The petitioner shall not tamper or prevail upon the prosecution witnesses in any manner.
(ii) The petitioner shall attend the court on all dates of hearing.
(iii) The petitioner shall not leave the jurisdiction of the court below without prior permission.
(iv) the petitioner shall cooperate with the Investigating Authority.

Sanjay Alias Machhi vs State Of Haryana on 19 September, 2018 IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH CRM-M-30325-2018 Date of decision: -19. 9. 2018 Sanjay alias Machhi. .. Petitioner Versus State of Haryana. .. Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE H. S. MADAAN Present: Mr. Rajesh Bansal, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Neeraj Poswal, AAG, Haryana. H. S. MADAAN, J. This petition for regular bail has been filed by petitioner - Sanjay alias Machhi- an accused in FIR No. 459 dated 17. 5. 2018, under Sections 341, 354-A, 354-D, 506 IPC (Section 8 of POCSO Act added later on), registered with Police Station Chandni Bagh, District Panipat. Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution story, are that the complainant(name not being mentioned to conceal her identity and referred to as 'the victim') daughter of Dharamvir, resident of Shashtri Colony, Panipat, a student of 10th class in R. S. High School, Panipat had lodged the FIR in question by submitting a written complaint to Incharge, Police Post Kishanpura, Panipat. Inter alia in the complaint, she submitted that when she used to go to school then accused Sanjay alias Machhi son of Shobh Raj, resident of their locality used to follow her and passed obscene remarks; that on 15. 5. 2018 while she was going in the street then Sanjay alias Machhi intercepted her catching hold of her hand and indulged in teasing her, threatening her that if she disclosed the incident to anyone, then he would kill her. Accused was arrested in this case on 17. 5. 2018. After completion of investigation, he has been challaned and now the case is pending trial. He had filed an application for regular bail in the Court of Sessions, which was declined by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Panipat vide order dated 3. 7. 2018, as such, he has approached this Court with the same request. Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State and counsel representing the State has put in appearance. I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going through the record. After hearing the rival contentions of learned counsel for the parties, I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young girls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture out of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is fast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial stage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to control. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls need to be dealt with an iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them. The petitioner has indulged in teasing a minor girl of his own locality catching hold of her hand with intent to outrage her modesty and gave beatings to her. He also threatened to kill her brothers. The trial against the petitioner is going on. The statement of victim/prosecutrix is yet to be recorded. The guilt of the accused shall be determined during the trial. The apprehension expressed by the State counsel that if petitioner is granted bail, there is every likelihood to his absconding and even trying to induce the prosecution witnesses, especially the prosecutrix and her family members, cannot be brushed aside lightly. Therefore, finding no merit in the petition, the same stands dismissed.

A. Sudha Maheswari. . Petitioner / Sister of
1. The Superintendent of Police,
Thoothukudi District, Thoothukudi.
2. The Inspector of Police,
All Women Police Station,
Pudukottai, Thoothukudi District
3. The Superintendent
Muthukuviyal Women Home and Hostel
Opposite to District Court,
Thoothukudi District. .. Respondents
Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India to issue a writ of Habeas Corpus to direct the respondents No. 1 and 2 to produce the body or person of the petitioner's younger sister namely Muthulakshmi (detenue) D/o. Mupidathi aged about 19 years before this Court and set her at liberty. For Petitioner: Mr. M. Prabhu For Respondents: Mr. T. Senthilkumar Additional Public Prosecutor
[Order of the Court was made by P. N. PRAKASH, J. ]
For the sake of anonymity, the detenue in this case is referred to as “X”. It is the case of the petitioner that her sister “X” aged 19 years, was sexually abused, in connection with which, a case in Pudukottai All Women Police Station Crime No. 1/2019 was registered on 01. 03. 2019 against the petitioner's mother and one Anbalagan, who is said to have abused the girl. During the course of investigation, it was found that “X” had conceived. However, the foetus was aborted and on the orders of the Child Welfare Committee, “X” was lodged in the third respondent hostel, where she continues to stay even now. Alleging that X is in the illegal custody of the third respondent, the present habeas corpus petition has been filed.
Today, Mrs. A. Ramalakshmi, Inspector of Police, Ms. S. Nagapushpam, WHC 870, All Women Police Station, Pudukottai are present. Ms. A. Muthulakshmi, (Assistant), Annai Sathya Ammaiyar Memorial Home for Destitute Children, Nilaikundam, is present. “X” was produced before us. When we enquired “X”, she stated that she is doing her 12th standard and that she is not in the illegal detention of the third respondent. She further stated that she does not want to go to the petitioner and wants to continue her studies.
The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the investigation in Crime No. 1/2019 has been completed and a final report has been filed in Spl. C. C. No. 25/2020 in the Special Court for POCSO cases, Tuticorin against the mother of “X” and Anbalagan and the case is ripen for trial. “X” should have to give evidence in that case and therefore, it would not be possible to shift her from the third respondent hostel or permit free access to her, because she could be intimidated and turned hostile. Therefore, we find “X” is not in the illegal custody of the third respondent for issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus. However, we direct the second and third respondents to ensure that sufficient protection is given to “X” and that she testifies in Spl. S. C. No. 25/2020 before the Special Court for POCSO cases. Accordingly, the Habeas Corpus Petition is dismissed.

R. Dakshina Murthy vs State Rep. By on 9 November, 2022. This Criminal Original Petition has been preferred to call for the records in Spl. S. C. No. 20 of 2020, on the file of the learned Special Judge (POCSO Cases) at Puducherry. The case in Spl. S. C. No. 20 of 2020 has arisen out of the FIR registered in Crime No. 158 of 2016 on the complaint given by the second respondent / defacto complainant. The defacto complainant and the accused Logashanmuga Perumal in Crime No. 158 of 2016 are relatives and shared the same household building by residing in separate portions. The allegation is that on 27. 10. 2016 at about 21. 30 hours, the accused Logashanmuga Perumal and Sumathi had assaulted the daughter of the defacto complainant on chest, stomach and private parts and thereby caused bleeding injuries on her and they also assaulted the other daughter of the defacto complainant. When the case was pending for investigation, the present petitioner has also been impleaded as one of the accused on the allegations made by the minor daughters of the defacto complainant about the sexual assault caused on them. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the husband of the defacto complainant and Logashanmuga Perumal / second accused are brothers and the third accused Sumathi is the wife of the second accused; the parents of the second accused, the family of the second accused and the family of the defacto complainant are living separately in three portions of the same building; though the complaint dated 29. 10. 2016 stated about the occurrence that had taken place on 27. 10. 2016, no allegation has been made against the petitioner; since the petitioner in his capacity as an advocate, has filed a petition to quash the FIR against the second and third accused; he has been falsely implicated in this case; even though there is no allegation of sexual assault made in the complaint, the defacto complainant developed these allegations subsequently; 164 Statement obtained from the daughters of the defacto complainant on 21. 01. 2020 and in view of that, the petitioner has been impleaded as an accused; so the allegations are made just to implicate the petitioner in this case. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the husband of the defacto complainant and Logashanmuga Perumal / second accused are brothers and the third accused Sumathi is the wife of the second accused; the parents of the second accused, the family of the second accused and the family of the defacto complainant are living separately in three portions of the same building; though the complaint dated 29. 10. 2016 stated about the occurrence that had taken place on 27. 10. 2016, no allegation has been made against the petitioner; since the petitioner in his capacity as an advocate, has filed a petition to quash the FIR against the second and third accused; he has been falsely implicated in this case; even though there is no allegation of sexual assault made in the complaint, the defacto complainant developed these allegations subsequently; 164 Statement obtained from the daughters of the defacto complainant on 21. 01. 2020 and in view of that, the petitioner has been impleaded as an accused; so the allegations are made just to implicate the petitioner in this case.

[case 157]
This is an appeal preferred under Section 14A(2) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, hereinafter referred to as the Act. The appellant is the accused in Crime No. 45/2021 of Vellikulangara Police Station in Thrissur District. The case was registered on the basis of the First Information Statement given by the victim girl, who is only 11 years old, alleging offence punishable under Sections 354, 354A(1)(ii), 354A(1)(iv), 354B, 447 of the IPC, Sections 7 r/w 8, 10 r/w 9(m) of the POCSO Act and Sections 3(1)(w)(i), 3(1)(w)(ii), 3(2)(Va) of the SC/ST POA Act, 1989. The substance of the allegation is that the appellant had taken the minor girl to the terrace of his own house at Maramkode, made sexual advancements against her after trying to denude her. When the child had escaped from his custody and run away to her house in the neighbourhood, he chased her by trespassing upon their property and called her through the window. The appellant was arrested on 21. 01. 2021 and since then is in judicial custody. The application for bail moved before the Special Court was dismissed by the impugned order dated 09. 02. 2021. Notice was issued to the victim as provided under Section 15A(5) of the Act. On receipt of notice, a counsel has entered appearance for the victim. The learned counsel on both sides were heard. According to the learned counsel for the appellant, there is no allegation of any aggravated sexual offence against the victim, that she has not suffered any injury, investigation is almost over, that the appellant is in custody for more than 48 days, he has two small children and also to look after his mentally re-tarted sister. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the victim submitted that the father of the victim is no more, the victim is being maintained by her mother who is a housemaid; they reside about two kms. away, the mother goes for work after taking the child to her sister's house and the appellant is the neighbour of that house; after the incident, the child is in a very frightened condition; they are afraid of the appellant. The victim is a 11 year old girl. There are prima facie reasons to think that the appellant had made advances against the child with clear intention of abusing her sexually. The place of occurrence is the terrace portion of the residential building of the appellant. The victim is a contemporanean of the children of the appellant. It is patent, at least for the present, that he had approached the child with malicious and corrupt intention to ravish her. The learned Public Prosecutor is not in a position to state the stage of investigation. But it is evident that final report is not yet filed. In the said circumstances and having regard to the submission of the learned counsel for the victim, that they are in a very traumatic stage after the incident, it is not in the interests of justice to release the appellant on bail. The allegations and the gravity of the offence also desist the Court from considering the application for bail at this stage. The learned Special Judge has dismissed the application for bail, taking into consideration all relevant aspects. There is no reason to interfere with the order. The appeal is dismissed.

UBAID TUESDAY, THE 17TH DAY OF OCTOBER 2017/25TH ASWINA, 1939 Bail Appl. .No. 7052 of 2017 () CRMC 1066/2017 of SPECIAL COURT FOR THE TRIAL OF OFFENCES AGAINST CHILDREN (ADDITIONAL SESSIONS COURT-I), MANJERI DATED 31. 8. 2017 CRIME NO. 192/2017 OF EDAKKARA POLICE STATION, MALAPPURAM.

O EDAKKARA POLICE STATION IN CRIME NO. 192/2017). BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI. SAJJU. S. THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 17-10-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: O R D E R The petitioner herein is the accused in Crime No. 192/2017 of Edakkara Police Station. He seeks pre arrest bail under Section 438 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the apprehension of arrest and custodial harassment in connection with the said crime registered under Sections 7 & 8 of the POCSO Act and Section 5 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The victim of offence in this case is a boy aged 17 years. His complaint is that on a day some time prior to 26. 7. 2017, the petitioner herein pressed on his penis, and thus sexually abused him. The complaint does not contain the date of the alleged incident. The complaint was filed by the victim on 26. 7. 2017, on the intervention of the child line people. The prosecution records would show that when examined under Section 164 Cr. P. C. , the victim stated the date of incident as 22. 6. 2017. The complaint does not contain any reason for the delay in making the complaint. It appears that the victim made the complaint at the instance of somebody. The petitioner's case is that the present complaint is the result of some other animosity. Let the factual aspects be probed into by the trial court during trial. In the present circumstances, where things are slightly doubtful I feel it appropriate to grant pre arrest bail to the accused. It will suffice that the petitioner is directed to report before the Investigating Officer for necessary interrogation. In the result, this petition for pre arrest bail is allowed. The petitioner is ordered to be released on bail on his executing a bond with two solvent sureties for 40, 000/- (Rupees Forty thousand only) each to the satisfaction of the arresting officer or the court below having jurisdiction, in case of his arrest in connection with Crime No. 192/2017 of Edakkara Police Station. Bail is granted on condition that; a) The petitioner shall report before the Investigating Officer between 10 a. m. and 11 a. m. on all Mondays for a period of two months. b) The petitioner shall not leave the limits of Edakkara Police Station for a period of two months. c) The petitioner shall not in any manner influence or intimidate the material witnesses, or he shall not have any contact with the material witnesses directly or over telephone or otherwise.

Smt. Mamta Tiwari vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 September, 2021. This criminal revision under Sections 397/401 of Cr. P. C. has been filed against the order dated 10. 08. 2018 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Gwalior in Special Case No. 86/2019, by which the charges under Sections 16 and 17 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (in short "POCSO Act") have been framed. It is submitted by the counsel for the applicant that the applicant is working as a Counsellor and during her routine inspection of Ashram Shanti Niketan Balika Grih, Birla Nagar, Hazira, Gwalior, the prosecutrix, who is mentally retarded minor and is staying in the Ashram informed that Jain Baba posted in the said Ashram was continuously violating her sexually. During the course of investigation, it was found that the applicant was aware of the physical violation of the minor prosecutrix, who was mentally retarded, and in spite of that, she did not take any action against Jain Baba. When the applicant saw misdeeds of Jain Baba, then instead of taking any action against the co-accused Jain Baba, she simply requested him not to do the said act. The Trial Court by order dated 10. 08. 2021 has framed charges under Sections 16 and 17 of POCSO Act. It is submitted that the allegations are false. The witnesses had not spoken against the applicant at the first instance, but only in the supplementary statement, it was alleged that the applicant had seen the misdeeds of co-accused Jain Baba and instead of taking any action against him, he had simply requested Jain Baba not to indulge in the said act. Thus, it is submitted that such allegation is afterthought and cannot be relied upon. Per contra, counsel for the State has supported the impugned order dated 10. 08. 2018. Sections 16 and 17 of POCSO Act read as under: "16. Abetment of an offence. - A person abets an offence, who- First. -Instigates any person to do that offence; or Secondly. - Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that offence, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that offence; or Thirdly. -Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that offence. Explanation I. -A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact, which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that offence. Explanation II. -Whoever, either prior to or at the time of commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act. Explanation III. - Whoever employ, harbours, receives or transports a child, by means of threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, abduction, fraud, deception, abuse of power or of a position, vulnerability or the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of any offence under this Act, is said to aid the doing of that act.

[case 160]
THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 16-03-2018,
THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING:
1. This petition seeking an order of pre-arrest bail is preferred
by the accused in Crime No. 42 of 2018 of the Hosdurg
Police Station, registered under Sections 366 and 377 of
the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5(I), (m) and 6
of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,
2012 (for short 'POCSO').
2. The aforesaid crime was registered on the basis of
information furnished by a minor girl who was studying in
the IV Standard. She used to travel to the School in the
autorickshaw of the petitioner herein. The child in her
statement has stated in clear and unambiguous terms that
while she was in the III and IV standard, the petitioner
used to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. It is
further alleged that on 11. 1. 2018, the victim was taken to
the residential home of the petitioner herein and after
removing her clothes, she was subjected to gross sexual
3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted
that the allegations are without basis. According to the
learned counsel, even if the allegations are admitted as
such, offence under Section 5 r/w. Section 6 of the Act will
not be made out. It is further alleged that other crimes
have also been registered at the instance of the minor child
which would render her case against the petitioner suspect.
4. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer. It is
submitted that the medical examination report of the victim
reveal that she was subjected to sexual abuse.
5. I have considered the submissions advanced.
6. Having regard to facts and circumstances, the contention of
the learned counsel that the petitioner is totally innocent
cannot be countenanced. The medical certificate of the
injured sufficiently corroborates the case of the
prosecution. In that view of the matter, it does not appear
to me that this Court will be justified in arming the
petitioner with an order of pre-arrest bail.
7. However, the learned counsel prays that a direction be
issued to enable the petitioner to surrender before the
jurisdictional court. I do not see any need for issuance of
any such directions. The petitioner shall surrender as
expeditiously as possible and if an application for bail is
filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be
passed on its merits.
This petition will stand dismissed.

Babu vs State Of Kerala on 29 November, 2017. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM. PRESENT: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJA VIJAYARAGHAVAN V. WEDNESDAY, THE 29TH DAY OF NOVEMBER 2017/8TH AGRAHAYANA, 1939. Bail Appl. .No. 8184 of 2017. PETITIONER(S)/ACCUSED: BABU, AGED 52 YEARS, S/O. THAMPI, CHEMBAKASSERRY HOUSE, PULAYETTIKKARA, ARAYANKAVU, ERNAKULAM DISTRICT. RESPONDENT(S)/COMPLAINANT: STATE OF KERALA. THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 29-11-2017, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER 1. This application is filed under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 2. The petitioner herein is the sole accused in Crime No. 1336 of 2017 of Mulanthuruthy police station, registered alleging offence punishable under Sections 450, 376(2), (i), (n), 506 IPC and Section 3(d) r/w Sec. 4, 5(1), (m), (n), r/w Sec. 6 of POCSO Act, 2012. 3. The victim in the instant case is a minor girl aged 13 years. Her mother is no more and her father has remarried and is living elsewhere. She is now admitted in the Don Bosco Snehabhavan at Ernakulam. It appears that when she appeared moody and showed behavioral problems, a Counselor interacted with her. The disclosure she made is heart rending. The Counselor informed the child line authorities who in turn intimated the police. It is in the above fact scenario that the crime was registered. 4. According to the victim child, who is now studying in the 8th standard, the petitioner is a near relative and she calls him 'valiachan'. According to her, when she was in the 2nd standard, the petitioner started sexually assaulting her. He used to touch her private parts and used to perform oral sex on her. She was made to touch his genitals as well. On various occasions thereafter, the petitioner repeated the same acts. As she had no one to disclose the sexual abuse that she was being subjected to and as she was confused, she did not reveal this fact to anyone. In the month of September, 2017, the petitioner repeated the same acts. This tormented her and she became moody and restless which fact was noticed by the Counselor. Pursuant to the registration of the crime, the petitioner was arrested on 28. 10. 2017 and has been in custody since then. 5. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is a 52 year old man and is undergoing treatment for cardiac ailments at the Kottayam Medical College Hospital for the past six months. It is submitted that there are serious inconsistencies in the statement given by the victim child. There was no way that the petitioner could have sexually assaulted the minor child is the submission. 6. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer and has made available the case diary for perusal. 7. I have gone through the same and It tells a very sad story. The victim child is a destitute with no one to look after and has been housed in various institutions since a very young age. The petitioner, by abusing his status as a near relative, has sexually assaulted the child. The investigation is still in the early stages and I find no reason to release the petitioner on bail. This application is dismissed.

[case 162]
Kerala High Court, Manikandan vs State Of Kerala on 14 July, 2020. The petitioner is the sole accused in SC No. 585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad. The case against the petitioner originated on registration of Crime No. 466 of 2018 at the Pudunagaram Police Station for offences under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Sections 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The allegation which led to the registration of the Crime is that the petitioner and the victim had eloped on 18. 05. 2018, when the victim was a minor and that, after marrying the victim, the petitioner had subjected her to penetrating sexual assault and had thereby committed the offences. The aunt of the victim, who had filed the complaint leading to registration of the crime has filed an affidavit stating that the victim, whose parents were no more, had eloped with the petitioner and had married him. A legal marriage was conducted on 08. 12. 2019, after the victim became major and the marriage was registered on 25. 02. 2020. One girl child is born out of the relationship between the petitioner and the victim and that the petitioner and the victim are living as husband and wife. The victim has also filed an affidavit reiterating the above facts and further stating that she has no subsisting grievance against the petitioner. It is stated that continuance of the harmonious marital life of the petitioner and the victim require quashing of the criminal proceedings. I heard the learned Public Prosecutor, who, on instructions, submits that the petitioner has no criminal antecedent and that the affidavit seeking quashing of the proceedings was submitted on her own volition. It is submitted that, though the sexual relationship of the petitioner with the victim was immediately prior to the victim becoming major, the fact that the petitioner had married the victim after she became a major and that both of them are leading a harmonious married life, can be taken into consideration. I take note of the fact that both the petitioner and the victim are rustic villagers and that after eloping from their parental homes, had married and lived as husband and wife. Immediately after the victim attaining 18 years, their marriage was registered and they are leading a harmonious marital life. Moreover, in view of the settlement arrived at between the parties, there is no possibility of the criminal proceedings ending in conviction. As such, continuance of the proceeding will amount to an abuse of process of court and hence, in view of the legal position set out by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Madan Mohan Abbot v. State of Punjab, Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another, there is no impediment in granting the relief. In the aforementioned peculiar circumstances, I deem it appropriate to allow the Crl. M. C, even though the offences alleged are under Section 376 (2) (n) of IPC and Section 6 r/w 5 (j)(ii)(I) of the POCSO Act. In the result, Crl. M. C is allowed; the proceedings in SC No. 585 of 2019 pending before the First Additional Sessions Court (Special Court), Palakkad, is quashed.

HOSDURG POLICE STATION, KASARGOD DISTRICT. R BY PUBLIC PROSECUTOR SRI. AJITH MURALI THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 16-03-2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: ORDER 1. This petition seeking an order of pre-arrest bail is preferred by the accused in Crime No. 42 of 2018 of the Hosdurg Police Station, registered under Sections 366 and 377 of the Indian Penal Code and under Sections 5(I), (m) and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO'). 2. The aforesaid crime was registered on the basis of information furnished by a minor girl who was studying in the IV Standard. She used to travel to the School in the autorickshaw of the petitioner herein. The child in her statement has stated in clear and unambiguous terms that while she was in the III and IV standard, the petitioner used to sexually assault her on multiple occasions. It is further alleged that on 11. 1. 2018, the victim was taken to the residential home of the petitioner herein and after removing her clothes, she was subjected to gross sexual abuse. 3. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the allegations are without basis. According to the learned counsel, even if the allegations are admitted as such, offence under Section 5 r/w. Section 6 of the Act will not be made out. It is further alleged that other crimes have also been registered at the instance of the minor child which would render her case against the petitioner suspect. 4. The learned Public Prosecutor has opposed the prayer. It is submitted that the medical examination report of the victim reveal that she was subjected to sexual abuse. 5. I have considered the submissions advanced. 6. Having regard to facts and circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel that the petitioner is totally innocent cannot be countenanced. The medical certificate of the injured sufficiently corroborates the case of the prosecution. In that view of the matter, it does not appear to me that this Court will be justified in arming the petitioner with an order of pre-arrest bail. 7. However, the learned counsel prays that a direction be issued to enable the petitioner to surrender before the jurisdictional court. I do not see any need for issuance of any such directions. The petitioner shall surrender as expeditiously as possible and if an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed on its merits. This petition will stand dismissed.

[case 165]
Gurmeet Singh @ Gurmit Singh vs State Of Punjab on 24 September, 2018 The petition under Section 438 Cr. P. C. for pre-arrest bail has been filed by the petitioner - Gurmeet Singh @ Gurmit Singh, an accused in FIR No. 91 dated 12. 8. 2018, under Sections 354, 506 IPC and Section 12 of POCSO Act, registered at Police Station Talwandi Chaudrian, District Kapurthala. Briefly stated, the facts of the case, as per the prosecution story, are that on 12. 8. 2018, the victim aged about 12 years, niece of complainant Mangal Singh, resident of Khijarpur, Police Station Talwandi Chaudrian, District Kapurthala had gone to the fields to pluck chillies, then at about 8: 30 a. m. , Gurmit Singh (present petitioner) caught her from her arm, hugged her, kissed her on face and started doing obscene acts with her; the victim freed herself from his clutches and ran away; the accused had threatened to kill the victim in case she disclosed the incident to anybody. However, on return home, the victim informed her uncle the complainant in that regard, who summoned Gurmeet Singh @ Gurmit Singh to his house and confronted him regarding the incident, then Gurmeet Singh @ Gurmit Singh started giving threats to them. The complainant accordingly reported the matter to the police. Formal FIR was registered. Apprehending his arrest in this case, the petitioner had approached the Court of Sessions seeking grant of pre-arrest bail by filing an application, however, his such request was declined by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Kapurthala vide order dated 24. 8. 2018. As such, the petitioner has approached this Court asking for the similar relief. Notice of the petition was given to respondent - State, which put in appearance through counsel. I have heard learned counsel for the parties besides going through the records. Pre arrest bail is a discretionary relief and is to be granted in exceptional cases and not in routine. It is meant to save the innocent persons from harassment and inconvenience and not to screen the culprits from custodial interrogation. In this case, there are serious allegations against the petitioner/accused of indulging in obscene acts with a minor girl and outraging her modesty. I find that the incidents of child abuse and molestation of young girls are increasing day by day. It is not safe for the womenfolk to venture out of their houses even. A serious law and order problem in that regard is fast emerging. In case precautionary measures are not taken at the initial stage, the things may get out of hand and would be very difficult to control. The persons harassing molesting and sexually abusing young girls need to be dealt with iron hand and no leniency can be shown to them. Custodial interrogation of the petitioner is definitely required for complete and effective investigation. In case custodial interrogation of the petitioner is denied to the investigating agency that would leave many loose ends and gaps in the investigation affecting the investigation being carried out adversely which is not called for. Thus finding no merit in the petition, the same stands dismissed.

[case 166]
This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in Spl. S. C. No. 98 of 2024 on the file of the learned Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Theni. The case of the prosecution is that the first petitioner had married the victim girls, who was not attained her majority and the first petitioner also had sexual intercourse with her. Hence, the case has been registered. The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners, learned Counsel appearing for the first respondent and the learned counsel appearing for the second and third respondent submitted that now, the petitioners and the second respondent/defacto complainant have settled the dispute between themselves amicably and the second respondent/defacto complainant is not willing to proceed further with the criminal case. Today, when the matter was taken up for hearing a joint Memo of Compromise was filed before this Court signed by the petitioners and the second respondent and their respective counsels. The petitioners and the second respondent/defacto complainant and the victim girl present before this Court, identified by Mr. P. Chellapandian, SSI, Jeyamangalam Police Station, Theni District, as well as by the learned Counsel appearing for the parties. This Court enquired both the parties, satisfied that the parties have come to an amicable settlement between themselves on their own voluntarily without any compulsion. The third respondent/victim had stated that both the petitioner and the third respondent/victim got married. They are living happily in a separate house and she did not want to pursue with the case. She has also filed an affidavit. The relevant portion of the affidavit reads as follows: 'I respectfully submit that now I realized that the petitioners have not committed any offence as stated above. Further the petitioners have not conducted my marriage and there was no harassment on the part of the first petitioner. ' The FIR and charge sheet were laid by the officials for statistical purpose and now I am living with the first petitioner happily and now the matter has been settled amicable, on intervention of both village and community elders. Since the matter has been settled amicable, I have no objection for quashing the impugned charge sheet against the petitioner in Spl. S. C. 98 of 2024 on the file of the learned Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Theni. The case has been registered for offences under Sections 9, 10 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 and 4(1) r/w. 17 and 18 of POCSO Act, 2012. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court.

With the said object, the Cinematograph Act, 1952 was brought into force by the Central Government with effect from 21. 03. 1952. Under the Act, the Board of Film Censors consisting of persons of eminence and responsibility was constituted for the purpose of examining and certifying films as suitable for unrestricted public exhibition or for exhibition restricted to adults. As per Section 4 of the Act, if the Board, after examination, considers that a film is suitable for unrestricted public exhibition or that, although not suitable for such exhibition it is suitable for public exhibition restricted to adults, it shall grant to the person applying for a certificate in respect of the film a 'U' certificate in the former case and an 'A' certificate in the latter case, and shall, in either case, cause the film to be so marked in the prescribed manner, and any such certificate shall, save as hereinafter provided, be valid throughout India [. .. ].

On 16. 12. 2013, the victim, a minor girl, aged about 17 years gave a written statement to the police, addressed to the DCP that about two years ago, Soni W/o Iliyas had met her with Suhail S/o Nabiullah. Suhail started talking with her on phone and also meeting her. On the pretext of marrying her, Suhail took her to the house of his brother Chhote Qureshi several times where he made forcible physical relations with her many times against her wishes. On her weeping and crying, accused Suhail took her to the house of Moni W/o Iliyas at Vasant Vihar where she was kept for about twenty days and with the help of Iliyas and Moni, Suhail again committed rape upon her on the false pretext of marriage. At that time she was about 17 years of age. When Suhail had met her with Moni, she was about 15 years and 6 months of age. When, she got rid of atrocities of Suhail, she asked him to let her go to her parents, otherwise she would commit suicide and that she could not believe that he would deceive her in such a manner and that whenever she got a chance, she would complain against him with the police. Thereupon, Suhail, Bade Qureshi, Chhote Qureshi, Akil Ahmad, Soiab, Moni and Iliyas, all favoured Suhail and gave her assurance to marry her with Suhail and she accorded to it in order to save her life and on 10. 10. 2013, her marriage/nikah was solemnized with Suhail before a court where her age was shown as 18 years in the marriage agreement, more than one year of her actual age. Thereafter, the said persons brought her to the house of brothers of Suhail at Gandhi Nagar where she was kept for two days. Thereafter, the said persons after a consultation amongst themselves kept her in a separate tenanted premises but Suhail told her that he wanted to live with his parents. She was kept well for a few days but thereafter, all the above persons demanded dowry from her, abused her and gave beatings to her and also threatened to kill her. On 07. 12. 2013, Suhail left her without informing her and when she called him, he used to give false assurances to her but did not turn up till date. The victim further stated that Suhail had been residing with his parents and threatening her that he would not keep her with him. At that time, she was carrying a pregnancy of about two months and that Bade Qureshi, Chhote Qureshi, Akil Ahmad and Suhail's sisters also started saying that they would not keep her and that Suhail had already left several girls like her and they could do nothing against him and if she tried to initiate any legal action against him, she and her family members would have to face consequences which she could not imagine. She further stated that they also came to her house and threatened her if she would not obey their commands, they would get her killed and they were in contact with bed elements. She stated that she belonged to a poor family and that is why they were ruining her life and were not keeping her with them.

The State - Rep. by The Inspector of Police, All Women Police Station, Coimbatore(East), Coimbatore District. (Crime No. 19 of 2015). .. Complainant / Respondent
PRAYER: Criminal Appeal filed under Section 374 (2) of Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 to set aside the Judgment dated 16. 11. 2017 of the Mahila Court, Coimbatore, passed in S. C. C. No. 15/2016, convicting and sentencing the appellant under Section 5 (l), (m), (n) and Section 6 of POCSO Act, 2012 to undergo imprisonment for life and pay a fine of Rs. 5, 000/- and in default, to undergo three months rigorous imprisonment.
The case of the prosecution as could be discerned from the evidence is as follows: The defacto complainant Nithya (PW1) is the wife of the appellant / accused Vishnubhaskar. The PW1 and the appellant were living separated for the last two years and Nithya (PW1) had left her girl child aged 3 years and 9 months with her parents living in Coimbatore, as she was employed in Bangalore. The victim child was unwell on 07. 10. 2015 and since PW1 was in Bangalore and could not make it, she had requested her husband (Accused) who was living in Coimbatore at Maniyakaranpalayam, Ganapathy, Coimbatore, to take the child to the hospital. The child was reportedly taken to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital and admitted for treatment and subsequently discharged on 08. 10. 2015. Further on 17. 10. 2015 and subsequent days the child was taken out by her father (Accused) at the behest of Nithya (PW1), during which time he committed penetrative sexual assault on his own child under the guise of checking her private part for any insect. The child had symptoms of restlessness, sleeplessness, frequent urination and itchy sensation in her private part and it was on 23. 10. 2015, that the child narrated her ordeal to Meenakshi (PW2) and to Shakunthala (PW4) who are the sister-in-law and mother of PW1 respectively. PW1 was informed immediately and she rushed to Coimbatore and took the child to the Sri Ramakrishna Hospital on 24. 10. 2015 at about 05. 00 PM. .. The damage caused to the psyche of the victim child is devastating and in many cases irreversible too. Sexual assault of a child that too by her own father is even more serious and deserves no leniency and it is a matter of shame that grounds are invented to save the appellant when the child's statements have pinned him down. This is just a tip of the iceberg and therefore such crimes deserve the maximum punishment with no leniency to be shown.

[case 183]
By way of the present matrimonial appeal, the appellant seeks to challenge an order dated 16. 11. 2018 passed by the Learned Family Court, whereby the Learned Family Court has directed that the custody arrangement of the 11 years old daughter of the parties would continue as decided by the earlier order dated 28. 07. 2018 wherein the interim custody of the child is to remain with the father for four days and with the mother for three days. The relevant and necessary facts for the adjudication of the present appeal are that from the wedlock of the parties a girl child was born in the year 2007 and she is presently a little over 11 years of age. Marital discord occurred in between the parties and the respondent (father) filed a Guardianship Petition bearing No. G. P. No. 2266/2018, seeking custody of the minor child on the ground that the petitioner herein was suffering from mental illness and treated the child with cruelty and did not permit the respondent to meet the child. The Learned Family Court vide order dated 13. 07. 2018 directed the appellant (mother) herein to remain present with the minor child on 18. 07. 2018. On 18. 07. 2018, the appellant did not appear nor was the minor child produced. An application for adjournment was filed on behalf of the appellant on the ground of illness of the child. A prayer was also made in the application for appointment of a counsellor/Child Specialist, to visit the residence of the appellant to counsel the child. Prayer for providing Protection to the female child was also made. On the said date, the respondent, brought to the notice of the learned Family Court that after the respondent had filed the guardianship petition, the appellant had filed a case against him under the POCSO Act. The Learned Family Court looking into the facts and circumstances of the case, perceived that the child was perhaps under pressure and therefore before forming any opinion, thought it fit to appoint a Counsellor to meet the child and submit a report as to the factual condition of the child. The Counsellor submitted his report, after interacting with the child, in the presence of two female Sub-Inspectors. In his report, he brought out that the child did not complain of any bad behavior towards her by the father and in fact expressed a desire to stay with the father only. He also reported that the child was confident and was speaking without fear. On 19. 07. 2018, the child was produced in the court from Nirmal Chhaya, where she was sent, keeping her best interest in mind, for one night on 18. 07. 2018. The Family Court has found that the child was happy in the company of the father and has repeatedly denied any misconduct towards her by the father.

Anmol Vikas Sharma vs The State Of Karnataka, on 15 February, 2017
This Criminal Petition is filed under Section 439 of Cr. P. C. , seeking to allow this petition and enlarge the petitioner on bail in Special Case No. 49/2016 in connection with Crime No. 2/2016 registered in Torangallu Police Station, for the offences under Sections 376(2), 363 of IPC and Section 3, 4 of POCSO Act.
A person by name Ravindra Pal lodged a complaint stating that on 8. 12. 2015, her daughter aged 14 years, had been to the school i. e. , Jindal Adarsh School at Torangal, Sandur Taluk, Ballari District, but she did not return home. On enquiry, the complainant came to know that the petitioner had abducted the victim girl without the permission of the guardian. The said information was given by none other than the brother of the petitioner and he assured the complainant not to lodge any complaint so that he will bring back the said girl. During the course of the investigation, the police have recorded the statement of the victim girl on 09. 01. 2016 wherein she has stated that the petitioner has persuaded her on the ground that her father always used to abuse her, he would look after her with all love and affection and that they can live happily together. On that persuasion, the said girl aged 14 years was kidnapped by him. In her statement she has stated that the petitioner had sexual intercourse with her and also threatened her with dire consequences that, if she disclose the same to anybody, he would kill her. Thereafter, he took her to his village in Uttar Pradesh and they stayed there for 15 days and, thereafter, it appears she was brought back to her house. Looking to the above said facts and circumstances, whether there was any sexual intercourse or not has to be considered by the Court. However the statement of the victim girl made before the police is very much available which is consistent with the statement given under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. with regard to kidnapping the victim girl aged 14 years. I can understand, about the consent, if the girl is on the verge of attaining the age of majority who knows the pros and cons of the act. But, here, the said girl is aged 14 years. The persuasion is apparent on the face of the record. If such situations are allowed to be continued, there would be no safety or security to the girl child in our country. Under the above said circumstances, I am of the opinion that the petitioner, at this stage, is not entitled to be enlarged on bail. The petition deserves to be dismissed. However, since the accused is in judicial custody for more than one year, the Trial Court is hereby directed to expedite the trial and dispose of the matter within six months from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.

Both these petitions encompass common question(s) of law, besides encompassing common prayer(s), therefore, they are amenable for being decided through a common verdict. For the sake of convenience, the facts are being extracted from CRM-M-5650-2022. The gravamen of the lis, as encapsulated in the instant petition, is centered upon the validity of the impugned orders dated 19. 02. 2021, which are enclosed with the instant petition respectively as Annexures P1 to P4, and whereby, the sanction for prosecution of the respondents No. 5 to 8, in Case No. RC 08(S)/2017/SC-III/CBI/New Delhi dated 22. 09. 2017, as sought by the C. B. I. under Section 197 Cr. P. C. , has been declined by the respondent No. 1-State of Haryana. Succinctly stated, the present case derives its origin from the infamous incident of Ryan International School, Gurugram, wherein, a student of 2nd class [a seven year old boy] [hereinafter referred to as the 'minor deceased'] was found murdered in the school premises. Initially, the investigation was conducted by the Haryana Police and they arrested one Ashok Kumar [a Conductor employed in the School Bus at the relevant time] as the accused behind the murder. Since there was a lot of hue and cry and the matter was highlighted throughout media, and, even the father of the minor deceased approached the Hon'ble Supreme Court for transfer of investigation, therefore, the State of Haryana issued a gazette notification, thus transferring the investigation of this case to the C. B. I. The investigation of the C. B. I. culminated in a juvenile student of the same school, namely, Bholu [imaginary name given by the trial Court to conceal the identity of the juvenile student] [hereinafter referred to as the 'C. C. L. '] being the sole culprit behind murder of the minor deceased. Moreover, post conducting a through investigation, the C. B. I. also reached a conclusion that, in fact, Ashok Kumar was falsely framed in the murder and he is totally innocent. The further shocking revelations, as emerged from the investigation conducted by the C. B. I. are that, the Special Investigation Team [constituted by Commissioner of Police, Gurugram] not only created false documents, but, also pressurized the material witnesses to depose against Ashok Kumar. Consequently, a supplementary report was filed by the C. B. I. , thereby requesting to accord sanction under Section 197 Cr. P. C. for prosecution of some of the members of the Special Investigation Team [i. e. respondents No. 5 to 8]. This request was declined by the respondent No. 1 through rendering the impugned orders. Therefore, fetching grievance from the impugned orders, the C. B. I. has instituted the instant petition(s).

Ashok Ramchandra Shewale vs The State Of Maharashtra on 30 March, 2021. On 19th April 2019, a complaint was lodged at N. M. Joshi Marg Police Station by the mother of a child, aged 13 years 6 months, reporting about sexual assault upon her special child. It is alleged by her that on 19th April 2019, her another daughter informed that when the victim girl had gone to the toilet on the first floor of a building in a chawl, on 17th April 2019 at 9. 00 p. m, the Applicant - a resident of the same building latched the door from inside and sexually abused her. When the victim girl was taken into confidence, she narrated that after the applicant entered into the toilet and he latched the door, she was kissed by him on her lips and he also inappropriately touched her chest and her private part. He also threatened that if she informed about the said incident, she would have to meet with dire consequences. Thereafter, he opened the door of the toilet and left her. Based on the said narration, the complainant approached the police station on 19th April 2019 about the incident which took place on 17th April 2019 and lodged the FIR. The victim was forwarded for medical examination and was examined on 20th April 2019 after obtaining her consent. The history of the sexual assault narrated by the victim's mother is in sync with what she had disclosed to her mother about the applicant forcibly kissing her and fondling her breast. It is categorically recorded that she did not report any sexual intercourse. The child was medically examined and the opinion in column no. 11 recorded as ‘multiple old healed hymenal tears’. The statement of the victim girl was also recorded on 22nd April 2019. Based on the complaint, the FIR was registered under Section 354, 342, 506 read with Sections 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). When the charge-sheet is filed, Section 376 is also added. In absence of an allegation of 'rape' within the meaning of Section 375, prima facie the charge against the applicant under Section 376 cannot be justified. The medical examination of the victim girl which took place on the third day after the incident indicates 'multiple old healed hymenal tears'. However, neither the victim girl nor her mother had spoken about any penetration into her vagina or insertion of any object other than the penis. The version of the victim girl is only that of inappropriate touching without any reference to penetration. The applicant is arrested and incarcerated since 19th April 2019, and although the charge-sheet charges him with rapes, the trial Court is to determine the validity of this charge.

A. No. 4855 of 2018 Dated this the 31st day of July, 2018 ORDER This application is filed under Section 438 of the Cr. P. C. The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 339 of 2018 registered at the Vidyanagar Police Station, under Sections 342 & 363 of the IPC and under Sections 7 & 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The survivor is a girl aged 15 years. The applicant is alleged to be a near relative of a friend of the victim girl. It is alleged that the victim was informed by the applicant herein that her friend was with him and she was invited to the apartment of the applicant. She reached the apartment at about 9. 45 AM on 26. 06. 2018. She was wrongfully confined in the apartment till 4 P. M. and she was not permitted to leave. It is alleged that during the period that the minor child was with the applicant herein, he subjected the victim to sexual abuse by embracing and kissing her. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submits that he is innocent. According to the learned counsel, even if it is admitted that the allegations are true, the offence under the POCSO Act will not be attracted as the act was not committed with sexual intent. The learned Public Prosecutor points out that the victim was just 15 years of old and she was confined illegally and was subjected to sexual abuse by the applicant herein. I have considered the submissions advanced and have gone through the case diary. Prima facie, there are materials pointing to the involvement of the applicant. The allegations are grave. I am not persuaded to exercise the discretionary powers and grant an order of anticipatory bail to the applicant. The applicant is directed to surrender before the court below and seek regular bail. If an application for bail is preferred, the same shall be considered and order shall be passed expeditiously and on its merits. This application will stand dismissed.

Prayer made for is allowed. 4. Let necessary corrections/amendments be incorporated during the course of the day. 5. The instant revision is filed with prayer to assail the impugned order dated 30. 07. 2022 passed by Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge, POCSO, Court No. 2, Lucknow, under section 302, 201, I. P. C. Police Station: Chinhat, District: Lucknow, passed in Criminal Appeal No. 113 of 2022 arising out of Case Crime No. 107 of 2022, arising out of F. I. R. No. 1016 of 2021, lodged under section 302 I. P. C. at Police Station: Chinhat, District: Lucknow. 6. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the revisionist that the innocent revisionist has falsely been implicated in the present case. The revisionist hails from a family who have no criminal history. His further submission is that both the courts below have been swayed by the alleged seriousness of the offence, whereas for the purposes of enlarging the revisionist on bail under proviso to Section 12(1) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as Act of 2015) is significant, which has been overlooked by the court below, therefore, impugned judgment and orders dated 06. 06. 2022 & 30. 07. 2022 are not sustainable in the eyes of law. He has also submitted that no adverse report against the present revisionist has been given by the District Probation Officer concerned and whatever has been mentioned in the social investigation report against the present revisionist, is not based on any cogent material. He has further submitted that revisionist is confined in the Children Reformatory Home since 07. 04. 2022 in connection with the present crime.

Shivlal vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 12 June, 2023. This is the first application filed by the applicant under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. for grant of regular bail relating to FIR No. 228/2022 dated 24. 12. 2022 of P. S. Kindrai, District-Seoni (M. P. ) for commission of offence under Sections 363, 366, 294, 506 of the IPC and Section 3, 4, 5l, 6 of POCSO Act, 2012. He is in detention since 05. 02. 2023. As per the prosecution story, on 24. 12. 2022, 17 years old prosecutrix lodged an FIR stating that in October, 2021, one Devlal had proposed her for marriage. They both had talks on phone. On 04. 03. 2022, on false promise of marriage, Devlal had committed rape upon her. Thereafter, he repeatedly committed rape upon her. In the meantime, she had conceived from him. Now Devlal has refused to marry with her. FIR was registered. Later it was stated by the prosecutrix that present applicant, who is brother of Devlal, had uttered filthy words and had threatened to do death. Learned counsel for the applicant has submitted that applicant has not committed any offence. He is innocent. He has been falsely implicated only because he is elder brother of the main accused Devlal. He had not abused prosecutrix nor had asked her or her parents to abort her child. He never extended any threat to prosecutrix. It is submitted that in her earlier statement under Section 161 of Cr. P. C. , prosecutrix had stated nothing against the present applicant. Later on, by supplementary statement, he has been falsely implicated. There is no allegation against present applicant constituting offence of rape/aggravated penetrative sexual assault. Applicant has no criminal background. Therefore, it has been prayed that applicant be released on bail. Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case and totality of allegation against the present applicant, I am of the view that it is a case in which further pretrial detention of the applicant/accused is not warranted. Consequently, this first bail application under Section 439 of the Cr. P. C. filed on behalf of applicant, stands allowed. It is directed that applicant-Shivlal be released on bail on his furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs. 50, 000/- (Rupees Fifty thousand only) with one solvent surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court, for his regular appearance before the trial Court during trial with a condition that he shall remain present before the concerned Court on all the dates fixed by it during trial. This order shall be effective till the end of the trial. However, in case of bail jump and breach of any of the conditions of bail, it shall become ineffective.

S. Mundka, Delhi. The present FIR came to be registered on a complaint given by the elder brother of the child victim, wherein it was stated that the child victim, who was aged about 12 years and 02 months, had gone missing and it was suspected that their neighbor had enticed her away. Subsequently, on 30. 03. 2021, the child victim was produced before the concerned Police Station by her brother and her medical examination was conducted at Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Mangol Puri, Delhi.

Opposite Party: - State Of U. P. & Another. Counsel for Revisionist: - Akhilesh Kumar Pandey. Counsel for Opposite Party: - Govt. Advocate. Hon'ble Mrs. Saroj Yadav, J. This criminal revision has been preferred by the juvenile Vikas Soni through his father, under Section 102 of Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act of 2015 against judgement and order dated 13. 9. 2019 passed by Special Judge, (POCSO Act), Pratapgarh in Criminal Appeal No. 51 of 2019 Vikas Soni Vs. State of U. P. and order dated 2. 7. 2019 passed by the learned Juvenile Justice Board, Pratapgarh in Bail Application No. 39 of 2019 arising out of Case Crime No. 31 of 2018 under Sections 41, 411, 413, 414, 401 of Indian Penal Code, Police Station Government Railway Police, Pratapgarh. The brief factual matrix necessary for disposal of this criminal revision are as under: On 10. 7. 2018, a First Information Report was registered at Crime No. 31 of 2018 at police Station G. R. P. , Pratapgarh under Sections 41, 411, 413, 414, 401 IPC on the basic of recovery memo prepared by Sub Inspector against the revisionist and three others. According to recovery memo, the revisionist alongwith three others was arrested on the information given by a fink at the railway station, Pratapgarh, making preparation to commit theft. A mobile Samsung Phone of golden colour was recovered. He confessed to having stolen the mobile from train 4-5 days back. It has also been mentioned in the recovery memo that he is a habitual thief and has committed thefts earlier also. Investigation started. Revisionist claimed juvenility and was so declared by the learned J. J. Board vide order dated 11. 6. 2019. His age was found 16 years. He moved bail application before the J. J. Board and the same was rejected. Against the order of JJ Board, an appeal was preferred under Section 101 of the Act of 2015, that too was rejected. The passage details of the legal arguments submitted by both sides and the court's consideration of these arguments. The Judge emphasized that the juvenile's release on bail should not lead him into association with criminal elements, and must ensure the juvenile's protection from further harm. Given the nature of Vikas Soni’s circumstances and the Judge’s acknowledgment of the lack of adverse reports against him, what is the legal essence that upholds the juvenile's right to be released on bail despite the contention of habitual theft?

[case 200]
This petition has been filed to call for the records pertaining to the proceedings in Crime No. 17 of 2022 on the file of the respondent police and quash the same. The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner/A2 is the father in-law of the defacto complainant/second respondent. The second respondent/defacto complainant who was a divorcee is the second wife of the petitioner's/A2 son. The petitioner's son has already got two sons through his first marriage. He further submitted that the petitioner is having property at Chennai and the second respondent demanded to register the said property in the name of her minor daughter. Since the petitioner/A2 refused to do so, dispute arose between them due to which on 04. 05. 2022 the petitioner gave a police complaint against the defacto complainant before the All Women Police Station, Dharmapuri. The petitioner's son has filed HMOP No. 60 of 2022 on the file of the Additional Sub Court, Dharmapuri for divorce on the ground of desertion and cruelty. In order to take revenge against the petitioner/A2 and his son on 16. 07. 2022, the defacto complainant gave the present complaint against the petitioner/A2 with false allegations under the POCSO Act. Hence he prayed to quash the FIR in Crime No. 17 of 2022. On perusal of the FIR, it reveals that the respondent police had registered a case in Crime No. 17 of 2022 against this petitioner/A2 and another person who is the defacto complainant's husband for the offences under Section 9(1), 9(m), 9(n), 10 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Under Section 506(i) of IPC. The defacto complainant who is the mother of the victim girl has stated that her daughter who is aged about 15 years, was sexually abused by her father-in-law/the petitioner/A2 and by her husband/A1 and that they both threatened the victim girl not to disclose to any one. On coming to know that her daughter was abused sexually, complaint has been lodged. This Court finds that the FIR discloses prima facie commission of cognizable offence and as such, this Court cannot interfere with the investigation. Therefore, it does not meet the parameters laid down by the Supreme Court in State of Haryana vs. Ch. BhajanLal (AIR 1992 SC 604), M/s Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. Vs. State of Maharashtra and others (2021 SCC online 315) & PRATIBHA RANI Vs. SURAJ KUMAR & ANR (1985 Crl. L. J. 817). It is inappropriate to quash the FIR and close the investigation at the beginning stage. Therefore, I find no merits and investigation in this case is to be conducted to find out the truth.

No. 311 of 2016 on the file of the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai and consequently, re-open and re-call the witnesses of P. W. 2 Miss Sangeetha for the cross examination of the petitioner. This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to set aside the order dated 22. 01. 2018 passed in MP. No. 435 of 2018 in S. C. No. 311 of 2016 on the file of the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai and consequently, re-open and re-call Sangeetha (P. W. 2) for the cross examination of the petitioner. The petitioner is facing trial in S. C. No. 311 of 2016 before the Sessions Judge, Mahila Court, Chennai for the offence under Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'the POCSO Act'). It is seen that the victim girl was examined-in-chief on 22. 04. 2017 and she was not cross-examined by the learned counsel for the petitioner herein for the reasons best known to him. Thereafter, the petitioner filed CMP. No. 435 of 2018 in S. C. No. 311 of 2016 under Section 311 Cr. P. C. , to re-call the victim girl for cross-examination, which has been partly allowed by the trial Court on 22. 01. 2018, challenging which, the petitioner/accused is before this Court. Heard Mr. A. M. Venkatakrishnan, learned counsel for the petitioner/accused, who placed strong reliance on the order dated 13. 09. 2017 of the learned Single Judge of this Court made in Crl. OP. (MD). No. 9401 of 2017 and Crl. MP(MD) No. 6403 of 2017. .. . The victim girl who was subjected to sexual abuse cannot be asked to come to the Court again and again and undergo the ordeal and explain how she was subjected to sexual assault. Change of counsel cannot be a reason for re-calling the witnesses. In fact, in Vinod Kumar vs. State of Punjab [2015(1) MLJ (Crl) 288], the Supreme Court has clearly held that the prosecution witnesses should be cross-examined on the day itself, when they are examined in chief. .. . The reasons given by the trial Court for not re-calling the victim girl-P. W. 2 cannot be stated to be perverse warranting interference by this Court. In the result, this petition is dismissed as being devoid of merits.

Sri. Shivakumara vs State By Basavapatna Police on 13 September, 2017. This criminal petition is filed under Section 438 of CR. P. C. , praying to enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest in CR. No. 47/2017 of Basavapatna P. S. , Davanagere District for the offences P/U/S 9, 10, 11 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Sec. 10 of POCSO Act. The allegation is, the 1st petitioner married the complainant, now aged 17 years while she was 15 years of age. The marriage was celebrated on the Basava Jayanthi festival of 2015 and one year after the marriage, the complainant joined the husband and in-laws in the matrimonial home during April 2016. One month thereafter, the 2nd petitioner/mother-in-law used to complain against the complainant with her son and the 1st petitioner used to beat her. He used to come home in drunken condition, abuse her filthily and assault her. They harassed her to get away from the matrimonial home. When she was carrying pregnancy for three months, she was assaulted in the presence of her mother and thrown out of the matrimonial home. Her mother is a daily wager and since unable to maintain her, admitted her to Nirmala Hospital, Shivamogga, where she was provided shelter. The Doctor on coming to know her age as 17 years, took her to District Child Welfare Committee. She was in the Shelter Home and thereafter admitted to Mecgan Hospital, Shivamogga, for delivery. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are from Sillekyathar community and child marriage is very common in their community. They are not aware of the legal impediment against child marriage. They are nomadic people. If the petitioners are arrested, in all probability, it will shut the door of compromise for ever. The complaint allegation is false and probably brought at the instance of third persons. The offence invoked is under Section 10 of the POCSO Act which attracts punishment ranging between 3 years to 7 years. The sensitive question of child born from the marriage between the victim and 1st petitioner cannot be lost sight of. Though the complainant was a minor at the time of the marriage, it is not a marriage void-ab-initio, it is a voidable marriage. Being mindful of the consequence of the situation, this court is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the marriage that the petitioner shall be granted anticipatory bail for a limited period. The petition is allowed. The petitioners are granted anticipatory bail for a period of three weeks in Crime No. 47/2017 registered by the respondent police.

Smt. Mamta Tiwari vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 2 September, 2021. This criminal revision under Sections 397/401 of Cr. P. C. has been filed against the order dated 10. 08. 2018 passed by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), Gwalior in Special Case No. 86/2019, by which the charges under Sections 16 and 17 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (in short "POCSO Act") have been framed. It is submitted by the counsel for the applicant that the applicant is working as a Counsellor and during her routine inspection of Ashram Shanti Niketan Balika Grih, Birla Nagar, Hazira, Gwalior, the prosecutrix, who is mentally retarded minor and is staying in the Ashram informed that Jain Baba posted in the said Ashram was continuously violating her sexually. During the course of investigation, it was found that the applicant was aware of the physical violation of the minor prosecutrix, who was mentally retarded, and in spite of that, she did not take any action against Jain Baba. When the applicant saw misdeeds of Jain Baba, then instead of taking any action against the co-accused Jain Baba, she simply requested him not to do the said act. The Trial Court by order dated 10. 08. 2021 has framed charges under Sections 16 and 17 of POCSO Act. It is submitted that the allegations are false. The witnesses had not spoken against the applicant at the first instance, but only in the supplementary statement, it was alleged that the applicant had seen the misdeeds of co-accused Jain Baba and instead of taking any action against him, he had simply requested Jain Baba not to indulge in the said act. Thus, it is submitted that such allegation is afterthought and cannot be relied upon. Per contra, counsel for the State has supported the impugned order dated 10. 08. 2018.

Sri. Shivakumara vs State By Basavapatna Police on 13 September, 2017. This criminal petition is filed under Section 438 of CR. P. C. , praying to enlarge the petitioners on bail in the event of their arrest in CR. No. 47/2017 of Basavapatna P. S. , Davanagere District for the offences P/U/S 9, 10, 11 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act and Sec. 10 of POCSO Act. The allegation is, the 1st petitioner married the complainant, now aged 17 years while she was 15 years of age. The marriage was celebrated on the Basava Jayanthi festival of 2015 and one year after the marriage, the complainant joined the husband and in-laws in the matrimonial home during April 2016. One month thereafter, the 2nd petitioner/mother-in-law used to complain against the complainant with her son and the 1st petitioner used to beat her. He used to come home in drunken condition, abuse her filthily and assault her. They harassed her to get away from the matrimonial home. When she was carrying pregnancy for three months, she was assaulted in the presence of her mother and thrown out of the matrimonial home. Her mother is a daily wager and since unable to maintain her, admitted her to Nirmala Hospital, Shivamogga, where she was provided shelter. The Doctor on coming to know her age as 17 years, took her to District Child Welfare Committee. She was in the Shelter Home and thereafter admitted to Mecgan Hospital, Shivamogga, for delivery. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners are from Sillekyathar community and child marriage is very common in their community. They are not aware of the legal impediment against child marriage. They are nomadic people. If the petitioners are arrested, in all probability, it will shut the door of compromise for ever. The offence invoked is under Section 10 of the POCSO Act which attracts punishment ranging between 3 years to 7 years. The sensitive question of child born from the marriage between the victim and 1st petitioner cannot be lost sight of. Though the complainant was a minor at the time of the marriage, it is not a marriage void-ab-initio, it is a voidable marriage. Being mindful of the consequence of the situation, this court is of the opinion that it is in the interest of the marriage that the petitioner shall be granted anticipatory bail for a limited period. The petitioners are granted anticipatory bail for a period of three weeks in Crime No. 47/2017 registered by the respondent police.

G. Pappuraj vs The Chairman on 4 January, 2018. Before the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. This Writ Petition is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, to issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, calling for the records pertaining to the impugned notice issued by the 3rd respondent in his proceedings in Na. Ka. No. A3/12750/2017 dated 09. 10. 2017 and quash the same and consequently direct the respondents to appoint the petitioner in the post of Police Constable Grade II - 2017. The Chairman, Tamil Nadu Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, Chennai? 2, issued notification dated 23. 01. 2017 inviting applications for the post of Police Constables? Grade II, Jail Warders? Grade II and Fireman, 2017. The petitioner herein was eligible to apply for the said post. He submitted his application dated 05. 02. 2017. He was issued with the hall ticket. He took part in the selection process and was found to be successful. But, he was denied appointment on the ground that his character and antecedent were not found to be satisfactory. The third respondent issued the impugned memorandum dated 09. 10. 2017 in this regard. The learned Additional Advocate General drew the attention of this Court to the serious allegations made against the writ petitioner. He was implicated not in a petty criminal case, but a serious one. It was a case involving Section 4 of POCSO Act, 2012. The victim child had narrated the sexual abuse and torture to which he was subjected to. However, before the criminal Court, the prosecution witnesses turned hostile. It is obvious that in view of Ex. P7 marked in the said judgment, the acquittal rendered in favour of the writ petitioner cannot be said to be honourable. In all probability, the parents of the victim child were won over by the accused. A Full Bench of this Court held that by virtue of Explanation 1 to clause (iv) of Rule 14(b) of the Tamil Nadu Special Police Subordinate Service Rules, a person acquitted on benefit of doubt or discharged in a criminal case, can still be considered as disqualified for selection to the police service of the State. Considering the serious nature of the case, in which the writ petitioner was involved and the fact that the victim had given a statement under Section 164 of Cr. P. C. , I am of the view that no indulgence deserves to be shown to the writ petitioner. The order impugned in the writ petition is sustained. This writ petition stands dismissed.

When the informant went to the house of the petitioner, his daughter was there and he was not allowed to take his daughter back to his house. The informant was abused. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner has submitted that during course of investigation, the victim has given her statement under Section 164 Cr. P. C. that she on the date of occurrence she had gone to the house of Chandan Kumar Das. Her father has also arrived there but she did not return with her father. She has further stated in her statement that her father used to beat her that is why she did not return with him. She further stated that she was living with Chandan Kumar Das (petitioner) in a room at Gandhi Maidan where the petitioner had sexual relation with the victim. She has further stated that the relation was on their own will. From the perusal of the statement of the victim it is clear that it is a case of adolescence. The petitioner is having no criminal antecedent. He is in custody since 18. 05. 2024. The application for bail is opposed by learned APP for the State. Having heard learned counsel for the parties and considering the facts and circumstances of the case, this Court is inclined to enlarge the petitioner on bail.

Madhya Pradesh High Court Alagraj Panwar vs The State Of Madhya Pradesh on 24 February, 2025. The first application has been filed by the applicant under Section 483 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 for grant of regular bail in connection with Crime No. 382/2024 registered at Police Station - Kshipra District - Indore(M. P. ) for offence punishable under Sections 115(2), 118(4), 296, 351(2 ), 3(5) & 109 of BNS 2023. Applicant is in judicial custody since 16. 10. 2024. As per the case of prosecution, Alagraj and the child-in-conflict with law went to the house of their relative (brother-in-law of Alagraj), Ajay Singh on 14. 07. 2024 and abused him in filthy language for meeting his sister - Jatani. Alagraj assaulted Ajay Singh with wooden stick. Alagraj caught hold of Ajay Singh and the child-in-conflict with law assaulted him with knife. Sakku, Anu Bai and Jatani rescued him. Ajay was admitted at M. Y. Hospital, Indore, and was under treatment from 14. 07. 2024 to 20. 07. 2024. After discharge from the hospital, Ajay Singh reported the incident to Outpost Mangalia of P. S. Kshipra Distt. Indore. P. S. Kshipra registered FIR for offence punishable u/S 115(2), 118(1), 296, 351(2), 3(5) and 109 of BNS, against Alagraj and his son. The treatment paper of Ajay were requisitioned. The statement of witnesses were recorded. Alagraj was arrested on 16. 10. 2024. The learned Counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant has been falsely implicated. The trial would take time to complete. The applicant may be extended the benefit of bail. Per contra, the learned counsel for the State opposes the bail application on the ground of gravity of alleged offence. However, no criminal antecedent is reported against the applicant. The case diary and material on record reveal that the altercation aggravated into physical scuffle wherein the child-in-conflict with law assaulted his maternal uncle with a knife. Allegation against the applicant relates to assisting in assault. Injured Ajay was discharged after treatment for 6 days. Considering the absence of criminal antecedents and the socio-economic status, there appears to be no compelling reason to continue incarceration of the applicant. The trial would take time to conclude. Therefore, this Court is inclined to release the applicant on bail. Conditions may be imposed by the Trial Court under Section 437(3) of Cr. P. C. 1973/ Section 480(3) of BNSS, 2023.

[case 214]
The present appeal has been filed by the appellant/State being aggrieved by the order on sentence passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge whereby pursuant to the conviction of the respondent for offences punishable under Section 363 IPC and Section 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 ('POCSO Act'), vide order on sentence dated 10th February, 2015, the respondent was released on the period undergone. In this regard, it would be relevant to note the concluding paragraphs of the order on sentence passed by the learned Special Judge. "6. I have considered the rival submissions made by the Ld. APP and of counsel for convict. It is an admitted case that this is the first offence of the convict u/s 363 IPC and Section 10 of POCSO Act which is punishable with maximum imprisonment for five years with fine. Convict is stated to be having responsibility of his family. In the facts, and circumstances, having regard to the fact that this is the first offence of the convict, that offence u/s 363 IPC and 10 of POCSO Act is punishable with maximum five years imprisonment, to the economic condition of the convict's family and recommendation for probation made by the Probation Officer, Rohini, therefore, convict deserves to be given a chance for reformation by taking a lenient view. Accordingly, prayer of counsel for convict is accepted. Instead of sentencing the convict to punishment, convict is given the benefit of probation and is directed to file a personal bond of good behaviour and conduct in the sum of Rs. 10, 000/- with one surety in the like amount for a period of one year with the condition that he shall remain under the supervision of Probation Officer, Rohini Court for one year and shall report before the Probation Officer once every month and shall not commit similar offence during this period of one year and if any such offence is brought to the notice of this court during this period of one year, then this court will be at liberty to impose appropriate sentence upon the convict u/s 363 IPC and Section 10 of POCSO Act. The convict is informed that he has a right to prefer an appeal against this judgment. He has been apprised that if he cannot afford to engage an advocate, he can approach the Legal Aid Cell, functioning in Tihar Jail or write to Secretary, Delhi High Court, Legal Services Committee, 34-37, Lawyers Chamber Block, High Court of Delhi, New Delhi.

[case 215]
Can criminal proceedings involving non-compoundable sexual offences against women and children be quashed upon a compromise between the accused and the victim, invoking section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure? - this is the common issue that falls into consideration in these bunch of cases. The petitioners in all cases are the accused involved in sexual offences either under Chapter XVI of the Indian Penal Code (for short 'IPC') or under Chapter II of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO Act') or both. All of them seek to quash the proceedings on the ground of settlement with the victim. Since there were divergent views on the subject by the Apex Court and High Courts across the country, I have directed the Counsel for the petitioners as well as the Public Prosecutors to address arguments in detail. The learned Counsel for the petitioners submitted that High Court possesses inherent jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (for short 'Cr. P. C') to annul an FIR or criminal proceeding in appropriate cases where the offender and the victim have settled their dispute notwithstanding the fact that the offence involved is a sexual offence against women or children. The learned counsel further submitted that when the matter has been amicably settled, the victim would not support the prosecution case, and the possibility of conviction would be bleak. The continuation of proceedings, in such circumstances, would be a sheer waste of precious judicial time and public money, submitted the Counsel. Per contra, the learned Public Prosecutors submitted that rape or sexual offence against women or children is a heinous crime against society, and any compromise between the victim and the offender in relation to such an offence could not ordinarily provide for any basis for quashing the criminal proceedings in exercise of the wholesome power of the High Court under section 482 of Cr. P. C. They further submitted that compromises legalise rape and offer an escape route to the perpetrators. However, they fairly concurred with the view expressed by this court that there cannot be total embargo in exercising the extraordinary power vested with this court under section 482 of Cr. P. C. to quash criminal proceedings based on the settlement between the accused and the sexual assault victim in suitable cases to do complete justice to them.

No. 1016 of 2021, lodged under section 302 I. P. C. at Police Station: Chinhat, District: Lucknow. 6. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the revisionist that the innocent revisionist has falsely been implicated in the present case. The revisionist hails from a family who have no criminal history. His further submission is that both the courts below have been swayed by the alleged seriousness of the offence, whereas for the purposes of enlarging the revisionist on bail under proviso to Section 12(1) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (hereinafter referred to as Act of 2015) is significant, which has been overlooked by the court below, therefore, impugned judgment and orders dated 06. 06. 2022 & 30. 07. 2022 are not sustainable in the eyes of law. He has also submitted that no adverse report against the present revisionist has been given by the District Probation Officer concerned and whatever has been mentioned in the social investigation report against the present revisionist, is not based on any cogent material. He has further submitted that revisionist is confined in the Children Reformatory Home since 07. 04. 2022 in connection with the present crime. Only three years' institutional incarceration is permissible for a juvenile, under Section 18(1)(g) Act of 2015.

Bail Appl. .No. 4067 of 2018. CRIME NO. 711/2018 OF KARUKACHAL POLICE STATION, KOTTAYAM. PETITIONER/ACCUSED. RAJAPPAN K. K. AGED 70 YEARS, S/O KUMARAN, PONNAMPARAMBIL, SANTHIPURAM PO, NEDUMPADAPPALLY, NEAR KARUKACHAL. BY ADVS. SRI. LIJI. J. VADAKEDOM SMT. REXY ELIZABETH THOMAS SRI. RAJEEV JYOTHISH GEORGE. RESPONDENT/STATE: 1. STATE OF KERALA REPRESENTED BY THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR, HIGH COURT OF KERALA, ERNAKULAM. 682 031. 2. SUB INSPECTOR OF POLICE, KARUKACHAL POLICE STATION, KOTTAYAM DISTRICT. THIS BAIL APPLICATION HAVING COME UP FOR ADMISSION ON 26-07-2018, THE COURT ON THE SAME DAY PASSED THE FOLLOWING: SHIRCY V. , J. ================ B. A. No. 4067 of 2018 ================ Dated this the 26th day of July, 2018 ORDER Application for pre-arrest bail. 2. Petitioner is accused in Crime No. 711/2018 of Karukachal Police Station registered for the offences punishable under Sections 7 & 8 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO for short). 3. The prosecution allegation is that on 10. 6. 2018, the petitioner had sexually assaulted a minor girl child aged only 9 years and thereby committed the aforesaid offences. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the petitioner is a pretty old man aged 60 years. He has been falsely implicated in the case. He apprehends arrest and torture by the Police and hence this petition. 5. Learned Public Prosecutor has vehemently opposed this application and submitted that the investigation of the case is only in the initial stage. 6. A perusal of the records would show that the offence alleged against this petitioner is grave and serious in nature. Sexual abuse against women and children are increasing day by day. If anticipatory bail is granted in such cases, it will give a wrong message to the society. More over the investigation is only in the preliminary stage. 7. Considering the gravity of the offence alleged against the petitioner and the present stage of investigation, I think that if bail is granted to him, there is every possibility to intimidate the victim and thus to tamper with the investigation of the case. Hence, I am not inclined to grant pre-arrest bail. Accordingly, this Bail application is dismissed.

For the latter offence, he has been sentenced to life imprisonment and fined Rs. 2, 000/- and to further undergo two months simple imprisonment in default thereof. The brief facts of the case are that on 7. 9. 2000 Chhala Ram (PW-1) lodged a report (Ex. P. 1) at Police Station, Chirawa wherein he claimed that "his young son Mintu, aged eight years, was missing from the afternoon of 2. 9. 2000.

He was told that the child was seen leaving the house of Jai Prakash and after that he was not seen. Therefore, on 3. 9. 2000 he had filed a report for the missing child. He further claimed that in the morning of the 7th, at 6'0 clock, some of the villagers gathered and they started searching near the river. Around 9'O clock Bakhtawar and Jainarain Sharma, who went on the east side of the river among the tall grasses, discovered the dead body of his son and his clothes. He suspected that someone has killed his son. On the basis of the said report the police chalked out a former FIR, FIR No. 226/2000, and commenced the investigation. On the same day, the appellant was arrested as some of the witnesses had stated that they had seen the deceased on the last occasion with the appellant. Eventually, the police filed a charge-sheet for the offences under Section 377 and 302 IPC against the appellant. In order to prove its case the prosecution examined 15 witnesses and submitted 29 documents. Although the defence did not examine any witness, but it did submit the statement of Bakhtawar recorded under Section 161 Cr. P. C. as a document. After considering the oral and documentary evidence, the learned trial court was pleased to convict and sentence the appellant as aforementioned. Hence this appeal before us.

Asif vs State Of Haryana on 16 September, 2021. Asif-petitioner is seeking regular bail in the case bearing FIR No. 79 dated 04. 10. 2018 under Sections 211/343/506/34 of IPC and Section 4 of POCSO Act, registered at Police Station Adarsh Nagar, Ballabgarh. Briefly, the case has been registered on the allegations that the child victim aged about 13 years was sexually abused. The petitioner along with four other persons had sexually abused and committed oral sex. Love-co-accused has also sexually abused the child in the room of Rinku. The petitioner had taken the child to Sergarh where he was kept in custody. It has been argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that there is no allegation of sexual abuse of the child leveled against the petitioner. The petitioner along with four other persons are facing trial. All the accused except the petitioner and Rahul Kumar have been released on bail. Furthermore, Rahul Kumar, co-accused has also been granted bail by this Court. The petitioner is in custody since 17. 10. 2018 and is not involved in any other case. The statement of the victim as well as his parents have also been recorded. The trial of the case is going at fairly good pace and has opposed the bail application on the score that the co-accused have sexually abused the child aged about 13 years and they were sharing common interest with the petitioner. It is significant to note that the co-accused have been granted bail and the victim and parents have also been examined during the course of trial. There is no allegation with regard to sexual intercourse leveled against the petitioner. The petitioner has undergone incarceration for a period of more than two and a half years. The investigation of the case is complete, challan has already been presented and the conclusion of the trial is likely to take sometime on account of restricted hearing of the Courts due to Covid-19 Pandemic. As such, no fruitful purpose will be served by detaining the petitioner in further custody and sufficient mitigating circumstances are made out to extend the concession of the bail to the petitioner. Without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case, the instant petition is allowed. The petitioner is ordered to be released on bail on his furnishing requisite bail bonds to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court/Duty Magistrate concerned.

Ramseena vs State Of Kerala on 30 June, 2017. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KERALA AT ERNAKULAM. PRESENT: THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE SUNIL THOMAS. Bail Appl. .No. 4110 of 2017. The petitioner herein stands accused in Crime Nos. 742/2017 and 743/2017 of Sasthamcotta police station for offences punishable under sections 366A, 376 r/w section 34 of the Indian Penal Code and under sections 3(a), 5(1) 4, 6, 7 & 8 of POCSO Act, 2012. Both the above crimes relate to the sexual abuse of two young girls, who are sisters. The first accused in both the above crimes is Ramseena, the petitioner. The prosecution allegation is that, the said Ramseena got acquainted with the family of the victims. It is alleged that, Ramseena used to claim that she had spiritual power for healing and also for ostracizing. She enticed the younger girl among the victims, who was a 9th standard student, representing that if she offered prayer at a Dargha at Ervadi, she would get good marks in examination and would bring good fortune to the family. On the basis of the above promise, the family members entrusted the above victim to the custody of the said Ramseena. She took her to Ervadi and returned after few days. The girl committed suicide by hanging on 4/4/2017. Initially, it was thought that, she had committed suicide due to ill treatment of her younger brother, who was a physically challenged boy. The suicide note also referred to the conduct of above boy. Subsequently, it was brought out in the course of investigation that, when she was taken to Ervadi, she had stayed with Ramseena in the company of one Sarath, Sachin, Bipin. It is alleged that during their stay at Rameswaram and Ervadi, the above persons had sexually abused the girl. It is stated that, after return, she disclosed it to her elder sister. Crime No. 742/2017 was registered. In the course of investigation, Ramseena was arrested on 5/4/2017 and is arrayed as the first accused. Bipin was arrested on 11/4/2017. The allegation in Crime No. 743/2017 is that, utilizing her considerable influence over the family, Ramseena had subsequently persuaded the elder child, who is 17-year-old girl, to accompany her to Ervadi. .. Hence, it is clear that if Ramseena is granted bail at this point of time, she is likely to interfere in the course of judicial process and also to attempt to threaten and coerce the witnesses. ..

COURT: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD and HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE S. B. PD. SINGH
ORAL JUDGMENT (Per: HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE RAJEEV RANJAN PRASAD)
Date: 09-01-2025
Heard learned counsel for the appellant and learned Additional Public Prosecutor for the State. The trial court records have been received.
This appeal against the judgment of acquittal has been preferred for setting aside the judgment dated 24. 02. 2024 passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge-IV, Rohtas at Sasaram in Sessions Trial No. 411 of 2018 arising out of Dehri Rohtas Mahila P. S. Case No. 20 of 2018. The prosecution story is based on the written report submitted by Sunita Pandey. The informant states that she was married on 12. 06. 2010 with Binod Kumar Pandey and alleges being tortured for dowry. After verbatim details of charges, the report refers to the outcome of the trial in which the accused were acquitted. The learned trial court concluded that the prosecution could not establish its case beyond reasonable doubt and therefore acquitted the accused persons. Therefore, the grounds of this appeal now rest on the claim that there was indeed sufficient evidence to prove her case of cruelty and even attempted murder, yet the trial court rendered an unjust decision during the proceedings.

IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS DATED 01. 06. 2016 CORAM THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE P. N. PRAKASH Crl. O. P. No. 8911 of 2016 Srinivasan. .. Petitioner Vs. State Rep. By The Inspector of Police, G-9, Perunagar Police Station, Kancheepuram District. (Crime No. 290 of 2015). .. Respondent Petition filed under Section 482 Cr. P. C. seeking to transfer the investigation to CBCID, Kancheepuram. For Petitioner: Mr. M. Mohamed Hasai For Respondent: Mr. C. Emalias, Additional Public Prosecutor ORDER It is the case of the petitioner that his daughter X, a minor girl, was subjected to sexual abuse by one Srinivasan and that she delivered a child on 28. 09. 2015. On a complaint lodged by the petitioner, the respondent Police registered a case in Cr. No. 290 of 2015 for the offence under Section 4 of POCSO Act and Sections 294 (b) and 506(i) IPC against Srinivasan, who was arrested by Police and has now been released on bail. It is the grievance of the petitioner that the investigation is not going on a right line and therefore, he sought for transfer of the same to any Specialized Agency. This Court perused the case diary. Statement of the victim girl has been recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. and she has also been subjected to medical examination. It is the further grievance of the petitioner that the Police have not taken any steps to have the DNA Profiling done between the accused and child. A copy of the statement recorded under Section 164 Cr. P. C. is not available in the case diary. In a case of this nature, it would be sufficient, if the victim girl gives evidence with general corroboration from other sources. Under such circumstances, this Court is of the view, it is not a fit case to transfer the investigation to any other agency. Under such circumstances, this Court, in the interest of justice, directs the Deputy Superintendent of Police, Madhuranthagam, to supervise the investigation in Cr. No. 290 of 2015. The Inspector of Police, Uthiramerur, is directed to proceed with the investigation of the case by taking steps to have the DNA Profiling of the accused and child done by moving the jurisdictional Court. If the accused does not co-operate with the DNA Profiling, it is open to the Police to move an application for cancellation of his bail. With the above direction, this Criminal Original Petition is closed.

The present petition has been filed by the petitioner under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India read with Section 528 of Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (for short 'BNSS') seeking issuance of a writ in the nature of Habeas Corpus for the release of detenues, namely Gurleen Kaur and Ashbeer Singh, who are daughter son of the present petitioner, from the illegal custody of respondents No. 4 and 5 and to produce them before this Court. Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the marriage of the petitioner was solemnized with respondent No. 4-Banti Singh on 04. 07. 2013 and two children i. e. daughter Gurleen Kaur and son Ashbeer Singh (alleged detenues) have born out of the wedlock, who are aged about 10 years and 05 years respectively and presently, they are studying in a school at Abohar. The petitioner is working as Senior Constable in Punjab Police and presently, she is posted at Fazilka. It is further submitted that respondent No. 4 was indulged in wrong activities and has been involved in a case relating to offence under Section 376 of IPC. He is also involved in a case under the NDPS Act. Not only this, he is involved in a murder case also. He was also indulged in adultery as he has developed illicit relationship with a lady. The petitioner is not earning anything. When the petitioner stopped her from doing all this, he started extending beatings to her and ultimately, she was turned out of her matrimonial home. The petitioner had moved an application under Section 100 of BNSS before the SDM, Fazilka for handing over the custody of the children to her but vide order dated 02. 01. 2025, it was wrongly observed by him that the children were happily residing with respondent. However, a conversation which took place between the petitioner and her children has been placed on record before this Court in the form of a Compact Disc and it would reveal that in fact respondent No. 4 uses abusive language with them and also beats them. Learned counsel for the petitioner has further argued that the petitioner, being mother of the children, is legally entitled to get their custody. The children have been forcefully detained by respondent No. 4, who is not taking his proper care and for the welfare and wellbeing of the child, his custody must be handed over to the petitioner.

This Transfer Civil Miscellaneous Petition is filed to withdraw the H. M. O. P. No. 361 of 2023 on the file of the Family Court, Thanjavur and transfer the same to the file of the Family Court, Trichy. The case of the prosecution is that the marriage between the petitioner and the respondent was solemnized on 31. 03. 2019 at Thanjavur. At the time of marriage, the petitioner's parents were presented 18 sovereigns of gold jewels and household articles. According to the petitioner, from the date of marriage, the petitioner was put to harassment by her husband / respondent herein, for want of additional dowry. The respondent is having drinking habit. Under the influence of alcohol, he used to abuse the respondent. A male child was born to them on 13. 05. 2020. The petitioner was sent to her parents' home. Even after delivery of the child, the respondent has not come forward to see the petitioner and their child. Hence, the petitioner filed M. C. No. 32 of 2023 before the Family Court, Trichy and the respondent has filed H. M. O. P. No. 361 of 2023 before the Family Court, Thanjavur. Now the petitioner is living with her parents at Trichy. Since the petitioner is not an earning member, she has to take care of her child and since she is a dependant of her parents, she finds it very difficult to attend the Court proceedings at Thanjavur, along with her child and to travel from Trichy to Thanjavur. Hence, this Transfer Civil Miscellaneous Petition came to be filed seeking transfer of the proceedings in H. M. O. P.

Sri. Zabi Ulla vs State By on 4 March, 2025. IN THE HIGH COURT OF KARNATAKA AT BENGALURU DATED THIS THE 4TH DAY OF MARCH, 2025. BEFORE THE HON'BLE MR JUSTICE HEMANT CHANDANGOUDAR CRIMINAL PETITION NO. 5806 OF 2024. The petitioners-accused, who have been charge-sheeted for offences punishable under Sections 363 and 366 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), as well as Sections 3(a), 4, 5(j)(ii), 5(L), and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, are before this Court seeking relief. The prosecution alleges that the petitioners-accused, fully aware that the daughter of petitioner No. 2 (accused No. 2) was a minor at the time of the incident, solemnized her marriage with accused No. 1, and thereafter, accused No. 1 committed forcible sexual intercourse with her. As a result of this wedlock, a girl child was born. The petitioners-accused and the survivor are present before this Court and have filed a joint affidavit stating that the marriage of the daughter of accused No. 2--alleged to be a minor--was solemnized with accused No. 1 due to inadvertence and ignorance of the law. The affidavit further states that from the said wedlock, a girl child was born who is approximately six months old as of today, and that if the petitioners-accused are subjected to trial, it would result in their incarceration, thereby causing additional agony and misery. It is also stated that the survivor and her child are solely dependent on the petitioners-accused for their daily needs. Although the offences are cognizable and non-compoundable, considering that the survivor is approximately 19 years and 4 months old as of today and that a baby girl was born from the wedlock between accused No. 1 and the survivor, subjecting the petitioners-accused to trial would result in their incarceration, thereby causing further misery and agony to the survivor and the child rather than serving the ends of justice. Moreover, the petitioners-accused are illiterate, and the marriage was performed due to ignorance of the law. Under these circumstances, the continuation of criminal proceedings would constitute an abuse of the process of law. Accordingly, the petition is allowed.

Manu Sharma vs State Of U. P. And Another on 4 December, 2019. This application under Section 482 Cr. P. C. has been filed by Manu Sharma with a prayer for quashing the charge sheet dated 14. 02. 2017 as well as entire proceeding of Criminal Case No. 195 of 2017 (State Vs. Manu Sharma), arising out of Case Crime No. 204 of 2017, under Section 376 I. P. C. & Section 3/4 POCSO Act, P. S. Majhaula, District Moradabad, pending in the Court of Additional District Judge, Court No. 12 / POCSO Act, Moradabad. Learned counsel for applicant argued that it was a case of consensual physical relation, wherein prosecutrix was major. She was not examined for medical age determination because her certificate of High School regarding date of birth was with I. O. and as per above certificate her date of birth was 09. 03. 1999. It was mentioned in report at page no. 60. The occurrence of rape was said to be of November, 2016. It came to notice of the parents of prosecutrix when she was under pain in her abdomen and she was examined under ultrasound scanning, wherein she was held to be pregnant for three and half months. Report was not got lodged at that moment. Rather as per statement of complainant and his wife an attempt was made for getting marriage solemnized in between prosecutrix and applicant, which was said to be refused by applicant's parents. Thereafter, this case crime number was got registered. In ultrasound examination report, age has been said to be 19 years by prosecutrix and this document has been filed by prosecution side itself. Hence, it was a case of age running in between one and two months either way as to whether minor or major, but as per record of prosecution itself, it was a case of major because prosecutrix in her statement exchanged through hike messenger, in part of this document has said to be of year 1998, but date of birth written in school record was of 09. 03. 1999. On this score too she was major. It was a case of consensual physical relation wherein prosecutrix is still in conversation with applicant and he is still ready to marry with her, but her parents got this false case lodged and under defective investigation, charge sheet was filed, whereas applicant is innocent. It was misuse of process of law. ..

Md. Manjur Sah @ Manjur Sah @ Md. Manjura. .. vs The State Of Bihar on 14 February, 2025. The petitioner is apprehending his arrest in connection with Mahila P. S. Case No. 10 of 2024 registered for the offence under Sections 341, 323, 498-A, 504, 506 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and section ¾ of the Dowry Prohibition Act, lodged on 03. 03. 2024 by the informant Reshma Khatoon. The allegation in the FIR that the lady was married to this petitioner and was given the dowry. With the passing of time, she was blessed with a female child whereafter the attitude of the petitioner changed and she was tortured and subsequently, allegation is that he also brought a new lady claiming herself to his second-wife. To her further agony, the accused persons including the petitioner stop providing food to the informant and finally she was thrown out of the house. When the parents along with locals visited the place where abused/assaulted. Left with no remedy, the FIR was lodged. Earlier, this Court granted long rope to the petitioner to come to terms and in between the matter was also sent for mediation but as per the Mediator's report dated 01. 10. 2024, the same could not be resolved. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that only because he has consummated second marriage, the present case has been lodged. She has not been tortured for dowry and he is ready to keep her. Learned counsel for the informant on the other hand opposes the prayer submitting that a bare perusal of the FIR would show that the allegation is that: (i) she was tortured for dowry; (ii) he married again; (iii) she was not provided food and finally thrown out of the home; (iv) when the family members along with villagers wanted to resolve the issue, abused. Having gone through the facts of the case and the submissions put forward by the parties, certainly, the kind of allegation that has come against the petitioner, he does not deserve the anticipatory bail. There is not only allegation of torture for dowry, she was kept without food causing her physical and mental agony, ultimately thrown out of the house and in that background, it would be appropriate that he seeks bail. Accordingly, the anticipatory bail application stands rejected.

X vs State Of Nct Of Delhi (Acting Through Its. .. on 20 October, 2022. The present case raises important questions regarding the child survivors of sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse (hereinafter called "CSA") has been interpreted by the World Health Organisation (hereinafter called "WHO") as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent, or that violates the laws or social taboos of society. In a study, it was found that about 37% of India's population comprises children under 18, while around 53% of Indian children reported experiencing different kinds of abuse. The impact of the sexual offence is rightly pointed out in Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, wherein the Supreme Court reiterated that "Rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it is a crime against the entire society. It destroys the entire psychology of a woman and pushed her into deep emotional crises. .. " Owing to various emotional, social, and cultural factors, CSA survivors may not be able to express their feelings and experiences. The main rationale for this is that children are traumatized and are unsure of the proper words to express their encounter. CSA has long-lasting negative effects on mental health. The criminal claims the survivors life, if not physically then affecting their mental and emotional state. It, thus, becomes imperative that the survivor of the crime is not overlooked and rehabilitation for the sufferings of the survivor is not overlooked. There is duty cast on the State to protect their rights and deliver justice to the survivors. This justice, in the form of compensation, should be given its liberal meaning thereby giving the maximum benefit and as quickly as possible. The Law Commission’s 154th Report (1996) on reforms in criminal procedure discussed concerns related to ‘victimology. ’ A whole branch has evolved to make the victim the focus of their study. The tools employed by this study include an understanding of the victim-offender relationship, assessing, and possible ways for compensating the victims.

These Criminal Appeals are directed against the judgment of the Sessions Judge/Fast Track Court Mahaila Court, Thoothukudi, in Spl. SC No. 3 of 2014, dated 06. 07. 2015. The case of the prosecution is that prior three months to 30. 08. 2013, all the accused on different occasions had individually called the victim Mariselvi to their houses made her lie down on the floor undressed her full skirt and inserted the penis into her vagina and committed penetrative sexual assault and further more, A1 enticed the child by showing obscene pictures through CD and forced her to act of such. The Inspector of Police attached to All Women Police Station has filed a final report against the accused persons examining the witnesses.
The trial court after careful perusal of the entire materials available on record, A1 to A3 found guilty under section 5(l) r/w 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and each are convicted and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and to pay a fine of Rs. 2, 000/-, in default each to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 month. Aggrieved over the same, A1 to A3 are before this court as appellants by filing these criminal appeals.
In this case, PW2 is the victim, and PW1 is the mother of the victim. In respect of the place of occurrence, Exs. P14 and Ex. P16 (Rough Sketches) were marked. On perusal of Exs. P14 and Ex. P16, it reveals that the place of occurrence is shown as the house of A1 to A3. PW2 during her chief examination stated that A2 took her to his cement shop and subjected her to sexual intercourse. Further, the evidence of PW2 is corroborated with the evidence of PW1, PW5 and PW10/Doctor. The victim deposed about the sexual intercourse by all the accused and the rupture of hymen proved that the victim was subject to sexual assault. Considering the whole aspects of the matter and the evidence of the prosecution in the proper perspective, it is clear that all the three accused persons had committed sexual assault on victim twice each. All the accused very much ravished one after another and so it is proved that there was repeated penetrative sexual assault.

This Criminal Misc. Application is preferred under Section 482 of Cr. P. C for quashment of complaint being FIR No. I-CR No. 119 of 2012 registered with Kalavad Police Station, Jamnagar for the offences punishable under Sections 363, 366 and 376 of IPC and under Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short 'POCSO'). The complainant is duly served with the notice. Mr. R. V. Vinchi, Police Sub Inspector of Kalavad Town Police Station is present before this Court. According to him, complainant has no resistance, as the prosecutrix girl has already married to the applicant. It appears from the record that the applicant and the prosecutrix are having a child of 1 and ½ years old. The officer has also ensured that he shall further facilitate amicable settlement between the complainant and daughter. Considering the fact that the relationship of the applicant and the prosecutrix is already converted into a legal relationship of that of wife and the husband and when a child is already begotten out of the said wedlock, no useful purpose is likely to be served in continuing the criminal proceedings in wake of the chronology of events. The prosecution since is not going to result into conviction, the said litigation need not be continued any longer. Bearing in mind the decision of the Apex Court rendered in case of Gian Singh Vs. State of Punjab and Anr. , reported in 2012 (10)SCC 303. The request of the applicant to quash FIR needs to be acceded to.

This is a petition under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. P. C) seeking setting aside of order dated 10. 05. 2022 ('impugned order' in short) passed by the court of Learned ASJ-01 (POCSO) New Delhi District, Patiala House Court in Sessions Case No. 209/2018 titled as 'State Vs Pool Singh @ Phool Chand' arising out of FIR No. 145/2018, under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) & 9(K)/10 POCSO Act, PS Vasant Vihar, whereby petitioner's application under Section 311 Cr. P. C for recalling of PW-1/victim for her cross examination, was dismissed. The victim is a special child with mental disability of 50 percent. The present FIR came to be registered on the complaint of the petitioner’s sister. The complainant stated that on 06. 02. 2018 at about 4 pm, she had left the house along with her younger daughter to bring ration. When she returned home, her daughter ‘S’ told that her mama (maternal uncle)/petitioner had come in her absence and gave Rs. 100 to her father and sent him to the market to bring some eatables. Thereafter, finding her alone, the petitioner had touched her breasts and when she objected to the same and told him that she will inform her mother, he ran away. After filing of charge sheet, the victim ‘S’ was cross examined and discharged on 30. 05. 2019. On the other hand, the Learned Prosecutor strongly opposed this petition seeking its dismissal with cost. It is submitted that the victim/PW-1 was cross examined in May 2019 and the application for recalling her was filed nearly after three years of her examination; and even after the parents of the victim i. e. , PW-2 and PW-3 were examined. Nothing prevented the petitioner to take immediate steps if he was so aggrieved. The main plea taken before this court challenging the impugned order declining recalling of victim is, that the proxy counsel could not properly cross examine PW-1 on material particulars and that the same shall prejudice the petitioner’s case. The special legislation- POCSO Act was brought into being to effectively deal with sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of children and to punish the offenders of such heinous crimes against children.

[case 249]
This application is filed under Section 438 of the Cr. P. C. The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 1046/2018 of the Poonthura Police Station, registered under Section 11(IV) r/w Sec. 12 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, Section 376(2)(f) of the IPC and Section 3(a) r/w Sections 4 and 5 (n) r/w Sec. 6 of the POCSO. The survivor is a 15 year old child. The applicant herein is the husband of her aunt. According to the survivor child, the applicant had subjected her to sexual abuse while she was in the VIII standard. She went on to state that in the month of July, 2016, the applicant subjected her to penetrative sexual abuse. The learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the applicant had accommodated the survivor and her sister when her mother had gone to Singapore for work. He had maintained the children for years and it was only in the month of March, 2018 that the children had left his house and had joined their grand mother. In the initial statement given to the Police, there was no allegation that he had subjected the child to penetrative sexual intercourse. It was contended by the learned counsel that the applicant is innocent and he was roped in without a just cause. The learned Public Prosecutor submitted that the allegations are grave. The child did not disclose the entire facts initially as the wife of the applicant was also with her. In her 164 statement before the learned Magistrate, the child had stated in detail the gross sexual abuse that she was subjected to by the applicant herein. I have considered the submissions advanced by both sides and have gone through the 164 statement. Prima facie, it appears that there are convincing materials which point to the involvement of the applicant. In that view of the matter, this Court will not be justified in granting an order of pre-arrest bail to the applicant. I direct the applicant to surrender before the Investigating Officer or the court having jurisdiction and seek regular bail. If an application for bail is filed, the same shall be considered and orders shall be passed expeditiously and on its merits. This application is dismissed.

The wife did not seek any relief under Section 18(1) of the Domestic Violence Act and therefore, she is not entitled to maintain the petition. However, it is argued that under Section 12 of the Act, an application can be filed by an aggrieved lady to claim one or more reliefs. Each relief under Sections 18 to 22 are independent and can be claimed. A reading of the complaint shows there has been verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Hence, the complaint is maintainable. Therefore, the civil revision petition stands dismissed.

The case of the prosecution is that, the petitioner - accused fully knowing that the survivor was the minor, solemnized his marriage with her and committed penetrative sexual assault. The survivor and her parents were present before this Court on 20. 12. 2023, and filed a joint affidavit stating that the marriage of the survivor with the petitioner was solemnized inadvertently, and in ignorance of law, and from the said wedlock, a male child was born. They further stated that the survivor and the newly born child are dependent on the petitioner for their livelihood. If the criminal proceedings are allowed to continue, it would result in incarceration of the petitioner which would cause more misery and agony to the survivor and her child rather than securing the ends of justice. The petitioner and the survivor represented by her natural guardian have filed a joint affidavit that the sexual intercourse and the solemnization of their marriage was a consensual one. They would register their marriage upon the survivor attaining the age of majority. The object of POCSO Act is to protect minors from sexual abuse and not to criminalize the consensual relationship between adolescents who had consensual sexual intercourse without knowing the consequences. Though having sexual intercourse consensually with the minor is an offence under the POCSO Act, it would be appropriate to quash the impugned proceedings, otherwise, it would result in miscarriage of justice to the survivor and the child. Accordingly, petition is allowed. The impugned proceedings in Special C. C. No. 2432/2023. .. are hereby quashed. The petitioner to be released from judicial custody forthwith, if he is not required in any other case.

This Bail Application filed under Section 438 of Criminal Procedure Code were heard through Video Conference. Petitioners are the accused in Crime No. 2338/2020 and Crime No. 2337/2020 of Thiruvalla Police Station. The allegation against the petitioner in both the cases are same. Therefore, I am disposing these bail applications by a common order. Both the cases are registered based on the statement of the two kids of the petitioner's son. The allegation is that the petitioner, who is the grandfather of these two kids sexually abused the children in 2016 and 2018. Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Public Prosecutor. The counsel for the petitioner submitted that this is a false case foisted against the petitioner. The counsel submitted that there is a matrimonial dispute between the father and mother of the victims. The counsel produced Annexure A e-mail communications between the father and mother of the victim. The counsel submitted that a bare perusal of these e-mails which are in the year 2017 will show that the mother of the victim has got an enmity towards the petitioner. The counsel submitted that the allegation of sexual abuse was there in 2016 also. But such an allegation is not mentioned in these e-mail communications. The counsel submitted that this is false case foisted at the instance of the mother of the victim. The petitioner is aged 70 and is ready to abide by any condition if granted bail. The learned Public Prosecutor opposed the bail application, asserting that serious allegations are there against the petitioner from the children and custodial interrogation is necessary. After hearing both sides, I think, this bail application can be allowed on stringent conditions, considering the aged status of the petitioner. Moreover, it is well accepted that bail is the rule and jail is the exception. This Bail Application is allowed with specific directions regarding conditions to be met by the petitioner to ensure the integrity of the investigation.

HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD Case: - CRIMINAL MISC ANTICIPATORY BAIL APPLICATION U/S 438 CR. P. C. No. - 9864 of 2021 Applicant: - Jitendra Singh @ Jitendra Yadav Opposite Party: - State of U. P. and Another Counsel for Applicant: - Sanjay Pathak Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Pradeep Kumar Srivastava, J. Heard learned counsel for the applicant, learned A. G. A. for the State and perused the record. This is an application for the anticipatory bail given by the applicant Jitendra Singh @ Jitendra Yadav in Case Crime No. 0210 of 2021, under Section 354 I. P. C. and section 7/8 of POCSO Act, P. S. -Kotwali, District - Fatehpur. Submission of the learned counsel for the applicant is that informant side is tenant in the building of applicant and when he went there to demand rent, he has been falsely implicated in this case. Further submission is that he is teacher by profession and due to the F. I. R. police is inclined to make arrest, therefore, a prima facie case for anticipatory bail is made out. It is further submitted that applicant has no criminal history and applicant is prepared to furnish sureties and bonds, there is no possibility of his either fleeing away from the judicial process or tampering with the evidence. Learned A. G. A. has vehemently opposed the prayer of bail and has submitted that offence also pertains to POCSO Act and the victim child has given statement under section 164 Cr. P. C. supporting the F. I. R. version and has stated that applicant sexually abused her, therefore, no prima facie case has been made out for the anticipatory bail. In view of above and also that the case pertains to POCSO Act and the law has been enacted in order to prevent sexual abuse of the children, if in such kind of cases anticipatory bail is granted, this will frustrate the very object of law. I do not find any reason to grant anticipatory bail, therefore, the anticipatory bail application is rejected. Forum for regular bail is always open to the applicant.

This civil revision petition arises against the order of the learned II Additional District and Sessions Judge, Ranipet, Vellore District, in Criminal Appeal No. 81 of 2023 dated 23. 08. 2023 in confirming the order of the learned District Munsif cum Judicial Magistrate at Ranipet in CMP. No. 1495 of 2022 in DVC. No. 11 of 2021. DVC. No. 11 of 2021 has been presented by the respondents as against the civil revision petitioner. There is no dispute in the relationship between the parties. The petitioner married the first respondent on 06. 02. 2014 at Chengalpet. From the wedlock, the second respondent was born on 04. 09. 2016. The first respondent alleged that the petitioner never used to lend an ear to the troubles that the first respondent was facing or gave her any financial solace during the time they were living together. She would plead that the civil revision petitioner wanted only a boy child, but since a girl child had been born, and that too with health complications, he had forsaken/deserted the mother and child. Therefore, she had presented the aforesaid Domestic Violence Petition. On being served with the petition, the husband moved an application invoking the provisions of Order VII Rule 11. The learned Judicial Magistrate, on perusal of the complaint, came to the conclusion that the cause of action exists and therefore, dismissed the application on 04. 01. 2023. On appeal, the appeal was dismissed on 23. 08. 2023. Aggrieved by the same, the present revision has been filed. The wife's failure to seek relief under Section 18(1) of the Domestic Violence Act was claimed by the husband to disallowed her petition. However, it is established that under Section 12 of the Act, relief can be sought without necessitating Section 18 specifically. Allegations of verbal, emotional, and economic abuse are mentioned in her complaint, validating her petition. Therefore, the civil revision petition stands dismissed.

S. Mishra, J. The petitioner has filed the present application under Section 528 of the BNSS, 2023 r/w Section 482 of the Cr. P. C. , 1973, seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings arising out of Nayagarh P. S. Case No. 60 of 2022. The prosecution case originates from an FIR lodged by the informant on 10. 05. 2022, alleging that on 09. 05. 2022, the petitioner kidnapped her minor daughter (Opposite Party No. 3) and took away gold ornaments and cash of Rs. 8, 000/- from their house. Based on these allegations, Nayagarh P. S. Case No. 60 of 2022 was registered under Sections 363/366/376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) read with Section 6 of the POCSO Act. During the pendency of the trial, the petitioner and Opposite Party No. 3 entered into a marital relationship after the latter attained the age of majority. They are now living together as husband and wife, and the informant (Opposite Party No. 2) has expressed her willingness not to prosecute the matter further. Despite this, the question arises whether personal reconciliations should ever lead to dismissing serious charges such as those under the POCSO Act which were initiated to protect vulnerable minors from exploitation. What parameters can be utilized to assess whether the reconciliation, in this case, dissolves the need for continued legal action?

Dr. Jenbagalakshmi vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 20 December, 2024. This Criminal Original Petition filed under Section 528 B. N. S. S. , to call for the records in connection with FIR in Crime No. 1 of 2024 on the file of the All Women Police Station, Srirangam, Tiruchirappalli District and quash the same. On the basis of the complaint lodged by the second respondent, FIR came to be registered in Crime No. 1 of 2024 on 28. 02. 2024 against three persons including the petitioner for the alleged offences under Sections 5(l), 5(j)(ii), 6(1) and 21(1) of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (hereinafter called as 'POCSO Act') and Section 312 IPC. The case of the prosecution is that the victim girl is the younger sister of the second respondent/defacto complainant, that the victim girl, who was aged 17 years, was admitted in Trichy Government Hospital by her maternal aunt Meenakshi and she had called the second respondent to come to Trichy Government Hospital, that when the second respondent had gone to the hospital, it was informed by her maternal aunt that the victim girl was pregnant as she was having a relationship with one Ramkumar. The maternal aunt, to abort the fetus, had taken the victim girl to Sudharsana Hospital on 24. 02. 2024 where a scan was taken. On 26. 02. 2024, the victim girl was brought to Sudharsana Hospital by her maternal aunt to abort the fetus and at the time of abortion, since the victim girl failed to co-operate, she was taken to Trichy Government Hospital in a serious condition and died thereafter. The petitioner, a Senior Doctor, was named as the third accused. The petitioner contends that she refused to perform the abortion and instead referred the victim to a government hospital. The Supreme Court had emphasized that a medical practitioner cannot be held liable simply based on misadventure or an error of judgment. This Court holds that considering the above, the FIR against the petitioner is liable to be quashed.

Counsel for Applicant: - Nishi Agarwal, Dheer Sen Bhatt, Dinesh Kumar, Milan Singh Yadav Counsel for Opposite Party: - G. A. Hon'ble Mrs. Saroj Yadav, J. Heard learned counsel for both the sides. This bail application has been filed by the applicant in Case Crime No. 231 of 2017, under Sections 363, 366, 376, 504, 506 I. P. C. and Section 3/4 of POCSO Act, Police Station Shahbad District Hardoi. Learned counsel for the accused/applicant submitted that victim herself has stated that she had love affair with the accused/applicant. The accused/applicant has committed no crime. The statement of victim was recorded under Section 161 Cr. P. C. by the Investigating Officer. She has also been examined before trial court as P. W1, wherein she stated that she herself went with the accused/applicant. She is still living with him and has one child. So the accused/applicant should be enlarged on bail. The accused/applicant is languishing in jail since 04. 12. 2018. Contrary to it, learned A. G. A. opposed the bail application and submitted that victim was minor at the time of incident. So the accused/applicant should not be enlarged on bail. Considered the rival submissions and perused the record. The victim has stated in her statement before the trial court that she went with the accused/applicant on her own will, she got married with him and has one child out of the wedlock. She told that her age is 22 years. Even if the documents produced by the prosecution to prove the age of the victim is relied upon at the time of giving statement in the court she has attained the age of majority. Considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and without commenting on merit, it appears just to enlarge the accused/applicant on bail.

Abdul Husenmiya Shaikh vs The State Of Maharashtra And Anr on 2 September, 2021. By this application under Section 389 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 the Applicant seeks suspension of substantive sentence imposed by judgment dated 04/03/2021 passed by learned District Judge-2 and Additional Sessions Judge, Thane in Special (POCSO) Case No. 194 of 2018 and enlargement on bail. The Applicant was charged for offences under Sections 323, 354, 376, 377 and Section 506 of the IPC and Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. By the impugned judgment, the learned Judge has held the Applicant guilty of offences punishable under Sections 323, 354 and 376 of the IPC r/w. Section 4 of the POCSO Act. He has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years under Section 376 of the IPC and one year under Section 354 of the IPC and six months under Section 323 of the IPC. No separate sentence is imposed under Section 4 of POCSO Act. Charge against the Applicant is that he had committed rape / penetrative sexual assault on a minor girl aged about 8 years of age. The evidence of the victim prima facie indicates that the Applicant was involved in commission of the said crime. The medical evidence also suggests that there was evidence of penetrative vaginal intercourse. Thus, the material on record indicates that the Applicant, who is over 50 years of age has sexually abused the child who was barely 8 years of age as on the date of incident. The offence is not only grave but heinous in nature. There is prima facie material to believe that the Applicant was involved in commission of the crime. Considering the nature of accusations, gravity of offence and severity of punishment, in my considered view this is not a fit case for suspension of sentence and hence, the application is dismissed.

K. Govindan vs State Of Kerala on 24 August, 2020 The sole accused in S. C. No. 840 of 2014 on the files of the First Additional Sessions Court, Kasaragod has come up in this appeal challenging his conviction and sentence in the said case. The accusation in the case is that from the year 2012, the accused has committed rape on the victim girl aged 12 years in a shed near her house at Adkathbayal Beach, thereby committing offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i) and 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code (the IPC) and Section 3 read with Section 4 and Section 7 read with Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (the POCSO Act). On the accused pleading not guilty of the charges, the prosecution examined 13 witnesses on its side as PWs. 1 to 13 and proved through them, nine documents as Exts. P1 to P9. Among the witnesses examined, PW1 is the Chairperson of the Kasaragod Child Welfare Committee, PW2 is the victim girl, and the medical evidence in this case throws serious doubt as to the genuineness of the prosecution case as spoken to by the victim girl. It is difficult to believe the case put forth by the victim girl that the accused has committed vaginal intercourse with her on several occasions. I take this view also for the reason that prior to Act 13 of 2013, it was obligatory for the prosecution to establish at least an attempt on the part of the accused to commit vaginal penetration. The maximum punishment provided for the offence under Section 354 of the IPC, prior to Act 13 of 2013 was two years rigorous imprisonment or with fine or with both. In the result, the appeal is allowed in part. The conviction of the appellant is altered to one under Section 354 of IPC and the appellant is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rs. 10, 000/-.

This aspect has not been taken into consideration by the Investigating Officer and has submitted charge sheet in this case in a routine manner which is nothing but an abuse of process and prosecution needs to be quashed. On the other hand, learned A. G. A. has drawn attention of the court to the statement of the victim under Section 164 Cr. P. C. , in which, she has stated that she had fled from her house of her own free will and has married accused-applicant and she is pregnant of six months. In ossification test, her age is found to be 17 years and 16 years as per F. I. R. , therefore, she was minor on the date of occurrence and was not competent to give consent for marriage, hence offence under Section 3/4 of POCSO Act as well as under Section 376 IPC would be made out in view of judgment of Apex Court rendered in Independent Thought vs. Union of India and another, (2017) 10 SCC 800, in which it is held that if a child is below 18 years, she would be treated to be child irrespective of the fact whether she is married or unmarried. If any intercourse is made with such child, the same would be fall in the category of rape, hence quashing should be refused.

Smt. Ranjana Chaudhari vs State Of U. P. & Another on 3 January, 2018. This criminal revision has been filed under Section 397/401 Cr. P. C. against the order dated 23. 9. 2017 passed by Additional Session Judge, Court No. 1, Pilibhit, whereby he allowed the application of prosecution under Section 319 Cr. P. C. And summoned the revisionist to face trial for offences under Sections 323, 504 and 506 IPC in S. T. No. 10 of 2016 (State Vs. Sarvjeet Singh) under Sections 376, 504 and 506 IPC and ¾ POCSO Act, P. S. Sungarhi, District Pilibhit. It is stated in the grounds of revision that the impugned order has been passed absolutely against the spirit of the provision of Section 319 Cr. P. C. The first informant namely Shivani Gupta, her father Umesh Chandra Gupta and mother Smt. Poonam Gupta were produced under Section 311 of the Cr. P. C. , only to falsely implicate the revisionist as all of them were interested witnesses who sought private vendetta with ulterior motive to pressurize the revisionist. The power under Section 319 of the Cr. P. C. is conferred on the court to be used very sparingly which requires compelling reasons to exist for taking cognizance. No such compelling/cogent reason has been mentioned by the learned court below to justify the summoning of the revisionist. No satisfaction has been recorded by the court below to the effect that the evidence, if un-rebutted, would lead to conviction of the revisionist under Sections 323, 504 and 506 IPC. The revisionist was falsely and maliciously not named by her name but was named as wife of Sarvjeet Singh with two other boys with unknown names in the First Information Report. On the basis of no sufficient material being collected during investigation, charge sheet was not submitted against revisionist and the two other unknown boys.

No separate sentence has been imposed for offence under Section 377 IPC.

Per contra, it is submitted by learned counsel for the State that a child of 13 to 14 years was sexually abused and that not only the victim but other witnesses have also deposed about the incident and that learned trial Court after due appreciation of evidence, has recorded the conviction, therefore, considering the seriousness of the offence, it is not a fit case for grant of suspension.

The prosecution alleges that the victim, who was about 18 years old at the time of the incident, went to answer nature's call when the petitioner took her away to a field and forcibly had sexual intercourse with her. .. . Although the offences alleged are cognizable and non-compoundable, in view of the fact that the parties have amicably resolved the issue among themselves--and the survivor has stated that the sexual intercourse was consensual and that she depends on the petitioner to meet their daily needs--it would be futile to subject the petitioner to trial, as the probability of his conviction is remote and bleak in light of the settlement. Therefore, the continuation of criminal proceedings against the petitioner would be an abuse of the process of law. Accordingly, the petition is allowed.

X vs The State Of West Bengal And Others on 31 August, 2023. The petitioner is a 13-year old girl, represented by the Officer-in-Charge/Person-in-Charge, Snehachhaya Child Care Institution. The petitioner is a minor girl and a student of Class-VI, aged about 13 years. She is a survivor of aggravated penetrative sexual assault and sexual exploitation, allegedly by a person around 34 years old. The petitioner’s parents are migrant labourers who used to stay at Assam for earning livelihood and visit their native place once or twice a year. The petitioner, thus, had to stay alone at home with her younger sister. Subsequently, symptoms of pregnancy became visible and the petitioner was taken to the Digha State General Hospital on August 12, 2023. Thereafter, pursuant to a complaint lodged by the Superintendent, Digha SG Hospital, a First Information Report (FIR) was registered, inter alia under Section 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012. She was taken into safe custody under the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), Purba Medinipur. The petitioner is a victim of rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault and, as such, the continuance of the pregnancy resulting from such heinous crime constitutes a grave injury to the mental health as well as physical constitution of the victim. Thus, the termination of such pregnancy is immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant child. Accordingly, the Court directed the respondent to ensure that the petitioner is brought under the care of the Child Welfare Committee and shall undergo medical supervision for termination of pregnancy.

The prosecution case in short is that the petitioner/accused aged 62 years is a teacher in the Madrassa, where the minor victim girl aged 9 years used to attend religious instruction classes and that on 26. 06. 2019 at about 9a. m. , the petitioner/accused had sexually abused the minor victim girl aged 9 years, while she is in Madrassa by kissing her face and hands and biting on her lips. In the FI Statement, minor victim girl has stated that on the day in question she was alone in the classroom and the petitioner had demanded her that she should come and sit on his lap and she refused and thereupon he had forced her to sit on his lap and kissed on her cheeks saying that she is his daughter and that he had bitten her lips and that he had lifted her churidar top and touched her stomach and tickled her, etc. and that thereby the petitioner had committed the abovesaid offences. Smt. Noorji Noushad, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has fervently urged that the petitioner is innocent of the allegations and that he happens to be the innocent scapegoat in the factional fight between the two factions of Sunni viz. , AK faction and PK faction and that the petitioner is teaching in a Madrassa which belongs to one of the groups and that the petitioner has been victimized in the instant case, etc. Further the learned counsel for the petitioner would point out that though the incident is allegedly happened on 26. 06. 2019, the First Information Statement and the crime has been lodged only as late as on 06. 07. 2019 and the long and unexplained delay in the lodging of the crime will go to the root of the prosecution case as it affects the very credibility and believability.

The petitioner herein, is the mother of the victim in Crime No. 854/2015 of Edakkad Police Station for offences punishable under section 376 IPC read with section 3 & 4 of POCSO Act. The matter is now pending as SC. No. 111/2016 on the files of the Additional District and Sessions Court-I, Thalassery. The allegation is that her child was subjected to sexual abuse, while she was 13 years old. Accused is facing trial. Petitioner sought an early disposal of the case on the ground that the delay is causing great hardship, agony and trauma to the victim. It was stated that the victim was the only crucial witness. The learned Sessions Judge was directed to inform the approximate time limit within which the matter could be taken up, tried and disposed of. The learned Additional District & Sessions Judge-I, Thalassery, by his communication dated 5. 5. 2018, has informed that the total pendency of cases in that court is 1101. 62 cases are more than 5 years old, 22 cases involved under trial prisoners, 54 murder cases and 26 attempt to murder cases. In spite of this substantial pendency of cases which required urgent disposal, the learned Sessions Judge has offered to dispose of the matter within 8 months. Considering the huge pendency of cases, I feel that the learned Sessions Judge was justified in requesting for 8 months. Having considered this, I am inclined to direct the court below to take up SC. No. 111/2016 and dispose it of as expeditiously as possible, at any rate within an outer limit of 8 months from today. The court below shall take into consideration according to the learned counsel for the petitioner the crucial witness is only the victim.

This Writ Petition has been filed seeking for a Writ of Mandamus, to direct the respondents to expedite the enquiry and investigation on the petitioner's complaint dated 26. 03. 2024 within a time limit as may be fixed by this Court. The case of the petitioner is that, his daughter was kidnapped by his wife assisted by her brother and others with the help of Bagayam Police under the guise of having filed a Writ of Habeas Corpus, however the child was ill-treated and committed child abuse. Thereby, in order to protect the child, the petitioner has sent a complaint dated 26. 03. 2024 to the first respondent, who in turn, transmitted the complaint to the 2nd respondent for the field investigation and consequential report. Since the petitioner's complaint is pending for more than five months, the petitioner filed the above writ petition before this court for appropriate orders. Though very many grounds have been raised in this writ petition, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that, it would suffice, if this Court issues a direction to the respondents to expedite the enquiry and investigation on the petitioner's complaint, dated 26. 03. 2024, within a time frame that may be fixed by this Court. Learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents submitted that, the dispute between the petitioner and his wife is a family dispute and the same has to be ventilated only before the family court. However, without doing so, the petitioner has filed a complaint before the 1st respondent, which is wholly unsustainable. Hence, the prayer sought for by the petitioner cannot be granted and the writ petition is liable to be dismissed.

Avtar Singh vs State Of Haryana And Anr on 9 December, 2016. This petition under Section 482 Cr. P. C. has been filed challenging the order dated 09. 03. 2015 passed by Learned Additional Sessions Judge, Karnal, which allowed an application under Section 311 Cr. P. C. by which witnesses have been recalled. In brief, the facts of the case are that FIR No. 412 dated 02. 11. 2013 under Sections 376(f)(i)(g)(m) IPC and 5(F)(M) and 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act), at Police Station Indri was registered against respondent No. 2. In the said FIR, an allegation was made that respondent No. 2, being Principal of a school, had molested two young children aged four and five years. The matter was committed to the Court of Sessions for trial. After framing charges, many prosecution witnesses were examined, including minor children. By an application dated 05. 05. 2013, the respondent filed a request for summoning of the witnesses for further cross-examination, stating that there were certain documents not put to the witnesses. The Additional Sessions Judge allowed the application, stating that the accused has the right to defend and the minor child's cross-examination would be conducted with care. The petitioner argued that this order should be set aside due to ample opportunity already provided. The court upheld the right to recall witnesses under Section 311 Cr. P. C. but also highlighted the sensitivity needed when dealing with child witnesses under the POCSO Act. Ultimately, it dismissed the petition regarding summoning of the minor child, reflecting on the need to protect the interests and welfare of the child.

Niranjan Jaiswal And Another vs State Of U. P. And 2 Others on 10 February, 2025. High Court of Judicature at Allahabad Case - APPLICATION U/S 482 No. - 43621 of 2024. Applicant - Niranjan Jaiswal And Another. Opposite Party - State Of U. P. And 2 Others. Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Mishra, the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A. G. A. for State and Mr. Vijay Prakash Chaturvedi, the learned counsel representing victim. At the outset, the learned A. G. A. submits that notice of application under Section 482 was served upon first informant. However, no counter affidavit has been filed. The applicants, charge sheeted accused, have approached the Court for quashing the proceedings due to subsequent marriage with the prosecutrix, arguing the prosecution cannot be sustained. The prosecutrix has solemnized marriage with applicant on 17. 01. 2024. Parties entered a settlement outside Court and jointly filed an application for terminating the criminal proceedings. However, the A. G. A. opposed this, asserting that the prosecutrix was a child under the POCSO Act at the time of the offence, hence, the criminality stands. The counsel for the victim stated no objection to quashing the proceedings. This Court noted that compromise between parties can lead to quashing proceedings under certain conditions but risks remain with serious offences like those under POCSO. The court weighed public interest against the facts of the case. It concluded that the marriage and the victim's lawyer supports the application suggesting the criminality stands washed off, allowing the application and quashing the proceedings in Special Session Trial No. 74 of 2023.

Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD. The applicant seeks bail in Case Crime No. 128 of 2024, under Sections 137(2), 87, 64(1) of B. N. S. and Sections 3/4 of POCSO Act, Police Station - Kailadevi, District - Sambhal, during the pendency of trial. The applicant is stated to have enticed away the daughter of the informant aged about 16 years 6 months. The FIR does not whisper a single word about rape rather the allegations of rape have been added subsequently. There is no medical corroboration as the medical report indicates that LMP was started on 28. 08. 2024 and her medical examination was conducted on 02. 09. 2024. The victim, being 16 years and 6 months, indicates her age in a legally sensitive context as per POCSO. The arguments on behalf of the informant suggest that despite the lack of substantial medical evidence, the court must consider the principles of law regarding sexual assaults and the protection of minors, emphasizing the psychological and legal implications of such allegations. The court recognizes the necessity of the testimony of the victim and underlines the potentially traumatic impact of such incidents, leading to the consideration of bail in a sensitive manner. The court eventually grants bail to the applicant pending trial, emphasizing conditions to prevent tampering with evidence and ensuring presence during trial proceedings. The order emphasizes the necessity of respect for law and protection of victims when discussing criminal allegations. The applicant shall not tamper with evidence and must attend court when required.

Case No. 188/2015 - Convicting the appellant/accused for the offence punishable under Section 9(L)(M)R/w Sec. 10 of POCSO Act, 2012. The appellant/accused is sentenced to undergo R. I. for 5 years and pay fine of Rs. 50, 000/- in default of pay fine, he shall undergo R. I. for one fourth of the period prescribed for the substantive sentence. This appeal is against the judgment which convicted the accused under Section 9(L)(M) r/w Section 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act, 2012 and sentencing him to five years of imprisonment. The victim in this case, Disha, was alone at home when the accused entered with a pretext and committed the sexual abuse. The victim screamed and the parents then filed a complaint leading to the arrest of the accused. The trial court held that the prosecution established the guilt against the accused based on the victim's testimony and the complaint made. However, the appeal argues against the conviction alleging that the evidence was not cogent or consistent. The Court found that while the trial had deficiencies concerning evidentiary support and reliance on family testimonies, the accused, having suffered judicial custody for over two years, had his sentence reduced, though the conviction under POCSO was modified due to inconsistencies in evidence conveyed by witnesses.

Applicant - Niranjan Jaiswal And Another. Opposite Party - State Of U. P. And 2 Others. Heard Mr. Anil Kumar Mishra, the learned counsel for applicants, the learned A. G. A. for State and Mr. Vijay Prakash Chaturvedi, the learned counsel representing victim. At the outset, the learned A. G. A. submits that notice of application under Section 482 was served upon first informant. However, no counter affidavit has been filed. The applicants, charge sheeted accused, have approached the Court for quashing the proceedings due to subsequent marriage with the prosecutrix, arguing the prosecution cannot be sustained. The prosecutrix has solemnized marriage with applicant on 17. 01. 2024. Parties entered a settlement outside Court and jointly filed an application for terminating the criminal proceedings. However, the A. G. A. opposed this, asserting that the prosecutrix was a child under the POCSO Act at the time of the offence, hence, the criminality stands. The counsel for the victim stated no objection to quashing the proceedings. This Court noted that compromise between parties can lead to quashing proceedings under certain conditions but risks remain with serious offences like those under POCSO. The court weighed public interest against the facts of the case. It concluded that the marriage and the victim's lawyer supports the application suggesting the criminality stands washed off, allowing the application and quashing the proceedings.

Sri X vs The State Of West Bengal And Others on 17 August, 2023
The present writ petition has been filed by the father of an unfortunate minor girl of 11 years who is studying in Class V. The minor was a victim of a gang rape, which invited proceedings under Section 376DB of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under Section 6(1) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The minor, as of today, is pregnant for about 25 weeks and 6 days. The father of the minor, on her behalf, seeks medical termination of the unwanted and unwarranted pregnancy, in view of the trauma which would be suffered by the minor in the circumstances, if the birth of the child goes through. The learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner cites Sections 3 and 5 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 as well as the connected Rules of 2003. It is contended that although under Section 3(2)(b), the outer length of pregnancy which can be medically terminated under the Act is 24 weeks. The Act has to be taken as a whole. Explanation 2 of Section 3(2) provides that for the purposes of Clauses (a) and (b), where any pregnancy is alleged to have been caused by rape, the anguish caused by the pregnancy shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman. Such circumstances raise critical legal discussions regarding the rights and remedies available to the minor victim, especially focusing on her right to terminate the pregnancy due to severe mental and physical harms expected from carrying it to term.

X vs State Of Nct Of Delhi (Acting Through Its. .. on 20 October, 2022. The present case raises important questions regarding the child survivors of sexual abuse. Child sexual abuse (hereinafter called "CSA") has been interpreted by the World Health Organisation (hereinafter called "WHO") as the involvement of a child in sexual activity that he or she does not fully comprehend, is unable to give informed consent to, or for which the child is not developmentally prepared and cannot give consent. The impact of the sexual offence is rightly pointed out in Bodhisattwa Gautam v. Subhra Chakraborty, wherein the Supreme Court reiterated that rape is not only a crime against the person of a woman (victim), it is a crime against the entire society. Owing to various emotional, social, and cultural factors, CSA survivors may not be able to express their feelings and experiences. The Law Commission’s 154th Report on reforms in criminal procedure discussed concerns related to ‘victimology’. The criminal claims the survivor’s life, if not physically then affecting their mental and emotional state. Therefore, the courts must consider the gravity of the violation and the circumstances of each case, including the severe mental trauma experienced. The passage also specifies that the compensation awarded is to be based on several factors including immediate rehabilitation needs, severity of abuse, and loss of educational opportunities. This judgment is essential for lifting the veil on the severely undercompensated nature of child sexual abuse cases.

C against the petitioner in Crime No. 6 of 2021 on the file of the Inspector of Police, W-10, All Women Police Station, Flower Bazaar, Chennai. The allegation in the F. I. R indicates that both the petitioner and the defacto complainant / 2nd respondent had love affair and thereafter the accused appeared to have refused to marry the defacto complainant, thereby F. I. R. came to be registered for the offence under Section 376, 417 and 506(ii) I. P. C. Now, the petitioner and the defacto complainant appeared before this Court and they were identified by the respective counsel and the investigation officer. Both of them submitted that they are married on 04. 02. 2022 and living happily together now. They have also filed a marriage registration certificate. Though the offence under Section 376 and 417 I. P. C are not compoundable, on a perusal of the F. I. R. , it indicates that the parties had consensual relationship and no intention or deception could be notified to hold that there is no valid consent for intercourse. Further, both of them are married now and F. I. R came to be filed due to stained relationship before marriage. If the F. I. R taken into consideration for entirety, the same would not attract offence under Section 376 I. P. C as there is no ingredients to show that the consent was obtained by misconception of fact.

Balasubramani vs State Rep By on 16 June, 2017. .. THE VERY ESSENCE OF FATHER-DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN MAULED BEYOND RECOGNITION. An old saying goes like this 'The smile of a daughter is the secret purpose of every father'. On the contrary, here is the appellant who brought only miseries to her daughter and disgrace to himself. The victim girl was first sexually abused by her own father, the appellant, when she was studying VI standard and just after she attained puberty. As the victim P. W. 1 deposed, it all started in a very mild manner when she was fondled and made to believe that it was common. Subsequently, the appellant forced himself on her and when resisted he convinced her by mentioning that it happens in every family. The victim girl was in an age at which she was neither a kid nor a teenager. The absence of her mother who was away from home either in the night shift or due to her profession made things easier for the appellant. The appellant also did not have any sort of guilt feeling and continued with his activities forcibly. It is also learnt from the evidence that at one point of time, he went to the extent of threatening his daughter with dire consequences. He also threatened that he would murder her mother too if things were leaked out. The victim child had a trauma filled childhood and with no one to confide, she had tolerated her father's sexual assaults till she gathered courage to inform her relatives P. W. 4 and P. W. 5 and later called up the child helpline 1098.

The present revision is moved on behalf of the accused-applicants involved in Case Crime No. 287 of 2017, under Section 376-D Indian Penal Code, 1860 and Section 7/8 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, Police Station PGI, District Lucknow. The revision is directed against the order of Addl. Sessions Judge/Special Judge POCSO Act, Lucknow dated 22. 07. 2019. Learned A. G. A. termed the order impugned in this revision as an interlocutory order and argued against the admissibility under sub Section (2) of Section 397 Cr. P. C. The court noted whether the impugned order was passed misconstruing the provisions of Section 38 of the POCSO Act. The victim was a 5-year-old girl who was sexually abused at her school. The order allowing the victim to have an interpreter was challenged by the accused's counsel, claiming that the provision applies only to children with disabilities. The court elaborated on the necessity of providing an interpreter based on the age and ability of the child to communicate. Section 38 allows the court discretion in appointing an interpreter while asserting that being 'unable to communicate' differs from being 'disabled'. The court highlighted that the spirit of Section 38(1) aligns with the provisions of the Evidence Act, emphasizing the importance of ensuring the child can effectively communicate during judicial proceedings. The order was thus considered interlocutory and dismissed as non-admissible under Section 397(2) of Cr. P. C.

The instant writ petition has been filed by the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) challenging the constitutional validity of Sections 23(1) and 23(2) of the Pre­conception and Pre­natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, 1994 and seeking direction in the nature of certiorari/mandamus for decriminalising anomalies in paperwork/record keeping. The Society contends that the Act was meant to prohibit pre­natal diagnostic techniques leading to female foeticide. Despite this, the Child Sex Ratio has not improved significantly, and the Act is being implemented more in letter than in spirit. The Society argues that the ambiguous wording of Section 23(1) leads to grave injustices, equating clerical errors with serious offences such as sex determination. The inherent weakness in the law has resulted in proper doctors facing harassment without actual evidence of misconduct. Furthermore, Section 23(2) allows for the indefinite suspension of a doctor’s registration based on preliminary findings, assuming guilt prior to any conviction, violating the fundamental right to a fair trial as guaranteed by Article 21. The Act's presumption of innocence is a cardinal principle that should not be abandoned. In light of this, the Society seeks clarity on how best to address these discrepancies, positing that minor clerical errors should not lead to such drastic measures against medical practitioners.

The petitioner herein is the defacto complainant on whose complaint the respondent-police registered a case in their Cr. No. 23/2014 in respect of the offence under Sections 354, 376(i) and (j), 337 of IPC and Sections 4, 5(f) and (m), 6 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). The case of the prosecution is, the 1st accused works as a van driver for Xseed Pre-School, Sarajapura Road, Bengaluru. The respondents 2 and 3 herein (A-2 and A-3) are the Teacher and Ayah respectively. The victim child is aged 2 years 11 months and attends play group in the school. On 7. 1. 2014 since the child was crying, A-2 and A-3 handed over the child to A-1 who in turn took the child to a Maruthi van parked in the premises of the school and committed penetrative sexual assault on her. The application was contested by the defence and the learned Trial Judge rejected the application. Learned counsel continues, in all probability, A-2 and A-3 who received the child after the incident must have smelt the occurrence of the sexual abuse on the child, still they omitted to report the matter to the police or school Authority, thereby they have committed a serious crime. Statutory presumption operates about culpable mental state of the accused persons in committing the offence under Section 30 of the Act pervades the situation. By their omission and silence, they have committed the offence punishable under section 21 of the Act.

In the case 'Shailendra Yadav @ Shalendra Yadav vs The State Of Bihar', several juveniles are involved who have been accused of committing serious offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code and the POCSO Act. The main issue is the rejection of bail applications submitted by the Children in Conflict with Law (CICL) at the Juvenile Justice Board and various Children's Courts across Bihar. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, emphasizes the presumption of innocence for minors and states that bail should generally be granted unless specific criteria justify denial. The failure of the courts to provide subjective reasoning for rejecting bail requests and the use of social investigation reports may impact the future judicial treatment of minors implicated in serious crimes. Under Section 12 of the Act, a child should be released on bail unless it is shown that their release would likely lead to exposure to known criminals, moral danger, or defeat the ends of justice. The court also highlighted that the gravity of the offence cannot solely dictate the decision regarding bail. In this case, the court decided to overturn the previous bail denials and grant bail to the CICLs on various conditions, reminding the judicial system of the obligation to ensure the best interests of the child are prioritized rather than punishing them based on the severity of their alleged crimes.

NO. 175/2022 FOR THE ALLEGED OFFENCES U/SEC. 498A, 323, 504, 506, 109, R/W 34 OF IPC AND U/SE 3 AND 4 OF DOWRY PROHIBITION ACT. Respondent No. 2 lodged the FIR, alleging that her marriage with Accused No. 1 was solemnized on 23. 12. 2018. She claims that Accused No. 1 would return home late at night, pick quarrels, abuse, and assault her. On 10. 11. 2021, while she was three months pregnant, Accused No. 1 allegedly abused her in filthy language, kicked her, and dashed her head against the wall. Upon informing her parents, she was taken to her parental home. The petitioners have submitted a notice dated 29. 11. 2021, issuing to Respondent No. 2, asking her to resume conjugal rights. However, the FIR was lodged on 14. 09. 2022, nearly ten months after the alleged incident, with no plausible explanation for the delay. The complaint appears to have been filed with a revengeful intent. In the absence of specific allegations against the petitioners, merely proceeding on the basis of general allegations would amount to an abuse of the process of law.

No. 840 of 2014 on the files of the First Additional Sessions Court, Kasaragod has come up in this appeal challenging his conviction and sentence in the said case. The accusation in the case is that from the year 2012, the accused has committed rape on the victim girl aged 12 years in a shed near her house at Adkathbayal Beach, thereby committing offences punishable under Sections 376(2)(f), 376(2)(i) and 376(2)(n) of the Indian Penal Code (the IPC) and Section 3 read with Section 4 and Section 7 read with Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (the POCSO Act). The prosecution examined 13 witnesses on its side as PWs. 1 to 13 and proved through them, nine documents as Exts. P1 to P9, among them, the Child Welfare Committee's involvement is crucial.

However, without concrete evidence of specific dates or corroborative testimonies, the case's foundation comes into question. In the result, the conviction of the appellant is altered to one under Section 354 of IPC and the appellant is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years.

The applicant herein is the accused in Crime No. 200 of 2018 registered at the Vengara Police Station under Sections 354(iii), 509 of the IPC and Section 11(iii) and 12 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The victim is a minor girl studying in the VIII Standard. The applicant herein is a friend of her father. On 4. 8. 2018, while she was returning home after playing in the fields, the applicant along with one Haneefa were found standing in front of her house. Her clothes were wet as she had taken a bath. It is alleged that the applicant made certain gestures and sexually coloured remarks at the girl. The victim also alleges that the applicant has made similar gestures in the past. The learned counsel for the applicant contends that the allegations are baseless, claiming the victim's father is a habitual offender and demanding money from the applicant, who refused to pay. They cite a previous case where the same victim had previously alleged penetrative sexual abuse against three persons, which had turned out to be false. The learned Public Prosecutor was heard, and prima facie, the situation seems to indicate the applicant might have been framed. Thus, anticipatory bail was granted with conditions.

The said information was recorded vide DD no. 15 PP and was marked to HC Satbir Singh. Thereafter HC Satbir Singh reached at the spot where he met the child victim. The child victim gave a written complaint alleging that her aunt had beaten her up and abused her and had taken her mobile phone away. She also alleged that her uncle and another relative had committed rape upon her. Based on her complaint, FIR no. 127/13 was registered. Investigations revealed that the child scheduled an independent statement declaring that she made false allegations at the urging of another individual. During trial, despite her denials, the court ruled that the prosecution was unable to substantiate charges against the accused, and thus, decided to acquit them. This conclusion affirms an absence of criminal evidence proven in favor of the prosecution, leading to the dismissal of the case with respect to allegations of sexual offenses.

HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT ALLAHABAD. This case (X vs State Of U. P. And Another) revolved around a revisionist who was a juvenile involved in a criminal case where he faced charges under the IPC and POCSO Act. On 10 May 2023, the court heard arguments about the rejection of the juvenile's bail application by the Juvenile Justice Board. The revisionist was noted to be young, approximately 14 years old, and was claimed to have been falsely implicated in the matter. His defense pointed out the improbability of the charges against him, arguing that he was in protective custody and had no previous criminal records. The court discussed the significance of the Juvenile Justice Act regarding bail provisions, emphasizing that a juvenile should ordinarily be released unless strong evidence suggests otherwise. The arguments surrounding the juvenile’s upbringing, the lack of discipline and supervision from parents, and the necessity to ensure the child's best interests during judicial proceedings were critically analyzed. The court highlighted the importance of a social investigation report to aid its decisions and determined that the reasonings in the lower courts were not adequately based in law, which led to the eventual ruling that allowed the juvenile to be granted bail under certain conditions.

P. C. and Sections 7 Criminal Law Amendment Act, Police Station Maholi, District Sitapur. The revisionist, through his uncle, argues that he is an innocent child with no criminal background and the courts overlooked important factors regarding bail for juveniles under the Juvenile Justice Act. The gravity of the offence is not a relevant consideration for denying bail to a juvenile. The courts have failed to provide evidence linking the juvenile to potential danger or known criminals that would justify his detention. Hence, the need for proper assessment of the conditions set forth in Section 12(1) of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 is emphasized. The case highlights child protection laws and their implications on judicial decisions. The order dated 22. 3. 2023 allows the bail application with specific conditions for monitoring the juvenile's rehabilitation.

This Criminal Appeal is filed by the State challenging the Judgment and Order of acquittal dated 29. 04. 2015 passed by the II Addl. District and Sessions Judge and Special Judge, Dharwad in Special Case No. 2/2014. The case of the prosecution as is evident from Ex. P1 is that the prosecutrix had lodged a complaint on 31. 10. 2013 at 19. 20 hours accusing her father-accused herein of sexual abusing her from the year 2012. Based on the complaint the Appellant registered a case in Crime No. 108/2013, for the offences punishable under Sections 376(2), 377, 342, 324, 504, 506 of IPC and Section 6 of the POCSO Act, 2012.

Surendran M. @ Kalyani Surendran vs State on 10 March, 2021. The prosecution has charged a case of abject moral depravity in which five persons, aged between 48 to 79, were alleged to have ravished a minor girl, as complained of by the victim and her mother. The prosecution case rests squarely on the evidence of the victim. The revision and prayer for conversion as an appeal: The appeals are filed by the accused and after hearing commenced and continued for two days, requested for conversion of the RP into an appeal under Section 401(5) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The victim is enabled to file an appeal against such order of acquittal as per the proviso to Section 372 of the Cr. P. C. In this case the prayer for enhancement of sentence can be considered in the revision itself. However, the technical difficulty in retaining the revision for enhancement of sentence and converting a portion of it as an appeal must be noted. The allegations of abuse occurred after this date; thus we find no reason to interfere with the order of acquittal. The Court held that the evidences led by the accused cast serious doubts about the credibility of the victim's testimony, leading to the dismissal of the charges against the accused.

The present application under Section 482 Cr. P. C. read with Section 528 Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 has been filed for the following main relief: 'That this Hon'ble Court may graciously be pleased to quash/set aside the Impugned Charge Sheet under section-363, 366, 376 of Indian Penal Code & 5 J(II)/6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. It is stated that a perusal of allegations levelled in the FIR lodged by the opposite party no. 2, father of the opposite party no. 3/victim, would show that the victim, aged about 16 years, at the time of lodging of FIR, was enticed away by the applicant. It is further stated that the applicant was having an affair with the victim and due to this, she has married the applicant, of her own volition. This fact is evident from the marriage certificate issued by Arya Samaj Chandipurwa. Upon consideration of the age of the opposite party no. 3/victim, who is now 18 years old and the statements of the victim being supportive of the applicant's case, this Court views that interference is required as no fruitful purpose would be served in keeping the proceedings pending. Thus, the application is allowed and the entire proceedings are hereby quashed.

In the case of Manu Sharma vs State Of U. P. and Another, the High Court addresses a serious charge involving sexual offences against a minor under the POCSO Act. The case centers around Manu Sharma, who is accused of raping a minor student, who was under his tutelage. The prosecution contends that the victim initially did not disclose the abuse due to threats and the nature of their tutor-student relationship. It is revealed that the victim, who was 15 years old at the time of the offence, later became pregnant, prompting her parents to file a report against Sharma. Legal representatives for Sharma argue that the relationship was consensual, citing the victim's declared age in her high school documents. The Court discusses the importance of protecting minors under the POCSO Act, referencing constitutional provisions that empower the state to make special provisions for children and maintain standards for their protection from sexual offences. After considering both sides, the Court found the plaintiff's application to dismiss the charges was unmerited, emphasizing the legal protections in place for minors under sexual abuse allegations and the need for proper judicial proceedings in such sensitive cases.

Criminal Appeal No. 490 of 2018 is filed against conviction under Section 363 IPC and Section 5(l) r/w Section 6 of POCSO Act, resulting in five years imprisonment for the appellant, Sabari. The case arose when he allegedly kidnapped a 17-year-old girl from her grandparents' custody and repeatedly assaulted her sexually. The victim’s family filed a complaint after she went missing, but the victim later testified inconsistently. During the trial, several key witnesses turned hostile, questioning the evidence against the appellant. The trial court relied heavily on circumstantial evidence and presumption, raising concerns about the adequacy of the evidence leading to conviction. The appellate court found significant discrepancies and lack of solid proof, ultimately ruling that the prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant was acquitted, and the court raised important discussions on the handling of sex offenses against minors under the POCSO Act, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of consent and the resultant consequences on young individuals involved in consensual relationships.

In the case Gargian Sudheeran vs State Of Kerala, the accused, Gargian Sudheeran, is involved in two separate criminal cases concerning the disclosure of a victim's identity under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (PoCSO Act) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The first case, registered under Crime No. 2/2023, alleges that Sudheeran disclosed the identity of the victim in Crime No. 2113/2016 on May 28, 2022. The second case, registered under Crime No. 516/2023, involves similar allegations but regarding incidents on March 11 and 23, 2023. The accused has sought to quash both cases on the grounds that they arise from the same event, arguing that the prosecution is abusing the process of law by registering multiple FIRs for the same offence. The court examined arguments from both sides regarding the legitimacy of pursuing charges in multiple FIRs for allegations that, according to the defense, should be treated as a single incident. It was determined that the cases involve distinct actions that occurred at different times, hence they are not duplicative but rather different offenses that warrant separate legal proceedings, ultimately leading to the dismissal of the quashment requests.

Sri Javed Shafiq Rao vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2025
This petition is filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India along with Section 482 of the CR. P. C. to quash the Complaint dated 08. 02. 2024 for offences punishable under Sections 149 and 304 of the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner argues that he cannot be held responsible for the electrocution incident that caused the death of a child, as he had already transferred responsibility to the Homeowners Association prior to the incident. The complaint essentially states that the Association and its contractors had neglected their duty to provide a safe environment, which directly led to the tragic incident involving the respondent's daughter. The prosecution suggests that several others, including the petitioner, were criminally negligent. Nonetheless, the petitioner’s counsel points out that there are no specific allegations against the petitioner that would warrant him being held liable for the incident, as responsibilities were officially transferred well before the occurrence. After hearing both sides, the Court determines that these proceedings constitute an abuse of the legal process and consequently quashes the complaint.

Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. The Allahabad High Court’s judgment in the Satyaprakash case presents a critical reflection on how sensitive allegations of sexual offences against minors are approached within the legal system. The applicant's request for bail amidst serious charges under the POCSO Act incites careful deliberation about the legal implications of safeguarding child welfare. The court acknowledges the strong societal pressure surrounding such cases while reiterating the foundational legal principles including the presumption of innocence and the right to fair trial. Judicial proceedings also highlight the necessity for courts to adopt a rigorous approach towards evidence in sexual assault cases, particularly in safeguarding the rights of child victims while ensuring legitimacy in legal proceedings. Ultimately, the court's decision to grant bail is accompanied by strict conditions closely monitoring the applicant's actions to mitigate potential risks to the victim and society. This demonstrates an adherence to justice balanced with protective measures reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the ramifications of sexual crimes against minors.

No. 15 of 2021 now pending on the file of learned Sessions Judge (Sessions Court for exclusive trial of cases under POCSO Act) at Chennai. The petitioner would submit that there is no materials to charge the petitioner for the offences under Section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual offenses Act, 2012 or Section 12 of the POCSO Act; even according to the statement of the victim child, there is no statement with regard to the sexual abuse caused to her. The other witnesses had not stated anything about the commission of sexual abuse committed by the petitioner. Since the offence under POCSO Act are very serious in nature and it has stringent punishment, in the absence of any other solid materials, it is dangerous to proceed the case. Hence, I feel the powers of this Court under Section 482 of Cr. P. C. , should be invoked in order to secure the ends of justice. In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed. The proceedings in Spl. S. C. No. 15 of 2021 pending on the file of learned Sessions Judge is quashed.

Rajasekar vs The State Rep. By on 3 February, 2017 Crl. A. No. 176 of 2017
The appellant is in custody. This criminal appeal is filed to set aside the judgment dated 03. 02. 2017, passed by the Sessions Judge, Magalir Neethimandram, Coimbatore in Spl. C. C. No. 61/2014, in convicting the appellant herein under Section 3(a) r/w 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and sentencing him to undergo ten years and fine of Rs. 5, 000/- in default simple imprisonment for three months. The accused and victim girl, who is aged about 16 years, were friends. The victim girl is reported to be in six months' pregnancy at the time of medical examination, after having been subjected to repeated sexual assault by the appellant. The court held the prosecution has proved the charges of penetrative sexual assault beyond reasonable doubt. The law considers a person under the age of 18 as a child, thus rendering the victim's consent immaterial in this case. The victim expressed willingness to compound the offence, but the court rejected this claim based on legal precedents and provisions under the POCSO Act, identifying it as a non-compoundable offence. The appeal is dismissed.

The judgment discusses a criminal revision by a juvenile, X, representing his claim for bail under Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. The bail application had been rejected by the Juvenile Justice Board, citing concerns about the juvenile's possible association with known criminals and risks to his moral, physical, or psychological safety. The case involves serious charges under Sections 392, 302, and 411 of the Indian Penal Code. Despite the juveniles' claims of innocence and assertions that the case was based merely on circumstantial evidence, the Juvenile Justice Board and Appellate Court affirmed the rejection of bail. The court emphasized the importance of the social investigation report in making informed decisions regarding the juvenile’s welfare and the implications of his association with known criminals or risk factors. Finally, the court found that the previous judgments lacked proper consideration of the statutory provisions in favor of juvenile rehabilitation. Consequently, it allowed the juvenile's appeal, ordering his release on bail with specific conditions to monitor and support his reintegration into society.

Gaurav Kumar @ Gautam Kumar @ Gaurav. .. vs The State Of Bihar on 4 April, 2024. These batch of Revisions are filed, challenging the orders passed by the Children's Court rejecting bail of the Child in Conflict with Law (hereinafter referred to as 'CICL'), who have been made accused in different criminal cases concerning heinous offences. It is alleged by the petitioner that he was falsefully implicated in a case under Section 364/120(B) of the Indian Penal Code when he was aged about 16 years and 7 months. The principle of presumption of innocence applies to any child under 18 years old, with all decisions based on the child's best interests, and any rejection of bail must be justified based on specific conditions outlined in the Juvenile Justice Act. The court emphasizes that granting bail is the rule rather than the exception, and any decision must involve a thorough assessment of the child's situation and environment. The goal is to protect the child's development while ensuring they do not associate with known criminals upon release. The balance between protecting society and respecting the rights of the child remains a cornerstone of the juvenile justice system.

Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. The court proceedings highlight significant legal arguments related to the credibility and timeline of allegations leading to the arrest of Satyaprakash. The FIR’s delay raises questions regarding its validity, particularly in cases impacting minors as stated under the POCSO Act. The defense claims procedural delays and inconsistency in the victim's statements, as well as the absence of physical evidence from medical examinations. The rights of the accused under Articles 21 of the Constitution are emphasized; nonetheless, the court holds the need for caution when dealing with sexual offenses against minors, considering the potential trauma inflicted and the integrity of legal systems designed for victim protection. The court is required to weigh the evidence along with the legal premise that the victim's testimonial credibility is given considerable weight in sexual assault cases, reflecting the complexity of judicial processes in sensitive matters where allegations against minors are concerned. The judgment ultimately emphasizes the necessity of fair trials while protecting the victims' rights.

[case 577]
In the case of State Of Karnataka vs Sri Brahmadeva, the Karnataka High Court addressed a criminal appeal involving acquittal of an accused charged under the POCSO Act. The victim, a 14-year-old girl, alleged that the accused, her Physical Training Teacher, had abused her repeatedly from IV to VI standard. After a significant delay in reporting the abuse, the victim revealed the incident to her mother, which led to initial investigations. However, the trial court acquitted the accused based on various reasons including the lack of corroborated evidence, the testimony of alleged witnesses turning hostile, and unexplained delays in lodging the complaint. The prosecution argued the delay was due to the need for internal approvals, but the trial court found no indication that the victim was unable to report the abuse timely due to any external pressures or fear. The prosecution also failed to satisfy the legal requirements concerning corroboration of victim testimony as detailed in sections 29 and 30 of the POCSO Act. Ultimately, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision on grounds of insufficient evidence and credible doubt about the accusations.

In the State Of Karnataka vs R Rangaraju @ R Babu case, the Karnataka High Court dealt with a criminal appeal following the acquittal of the accused under multiple charges including wrongdoing related to domestic violence and murder. The case revolved around the death of Vimala, who was allegedly subjected to severe cruelty and later killed. The prosecution presented eyewitness accounts, including that of a child, to support their claims of murder and abetment, asserting that the accused had a history of demanding dowry and inflicting mental and physical violence on Vimala. However, the defense challenged the reliability of these eyewitnesses, suggesting that the death may have been a suicide rather than a murder. The High Court ultimately found failures in the prosecution's case, particularly regarding the credibility of the child witness and medical evidence, leading to a mixed ruling on the charges, successfully convicting the accused for Section 498A (cruelty) but not for murder. The judgment highlighted the necessity of corroborating eyewitness accounts with substantial and scientific evidence to establish guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

[case 586]
This is yet another sad saga of a three year old girl child, who was playing with her little dog, when she was noticed by a knave man who was driven by a desire of lust upon the sight of a little happy harmless child playing in her own world. The State is seeking confirmation of the death sentence passed by District Judge-7 & Special Judge under POCSO Act, Thane in Special Case (Child Protection) No138/2013. The fact that identifiable maggots were seen crawling over the body would show that the incident of rape and death of the victim was 3 days old and this has to be read in consonance with the fact that P. W. 10 had observed injuries on the foreskin of the penis of the accused which were 4-5 days old as he was examined on 3rd October, 2013. It is the bounden duty of the courts to impose a sentence which is proportionate to the offence committed by an accused. The accused in the present case deserves death penalty, as any alternative punishment would be unquestionably foreclosed taking into consideration the inhuman and barbaric act of the accused. Hence, the death penalty awarded to the accused deserves to be confirmed by this Judgment.

Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. The Allahabad High Court presents a pivotal ruling addressing the interplay of allegations under the POCSO Act and the frameworks required for ensuring victim protection. The applicant’s bail plea invokes various legal principles associated with the presumption of innocence, the significance of the victim's testimony, and the evolved norms surrounding minor protection laws.

Ultimately, granting bail to Satyaprakash, while imposing conditions like attendance at trial and barring evidence tampering, signifies the court's attempt to handle sensitive matters with the seriousness they require and embodying a commitment to justice for minors.

Madras High Court M. Mohamed Bashim vs The Commissioner Of Police on 1 July, 2024. This criminal original petition has been filed seeking a direction to the respondent police to give adequate police protection to the life and limb of the petitioner and his family members. The grievance of the petitioner is that the private respondents are preventing him from discharging his function as Imam in Al Muhammadhiyaa mosque and also attempted to assault him. The learned counsel appearing for the private respondents submits that the petitioner has tried to sexually abuse a small child, who has come to the Jamath for the purpose of learning Arab. Therefore, the Jamathars have agitated as against the petitioner. Considering the rival submissions made, this Court feels that it appears to be an internal affair of the Jamath. The petitioner has to workout his remedy in the manner known to law either by lodging a complaint before the Wakf Board or by filing a suit. In the event if anybody is taking law into their hands, it is always open to the petitioner to lodge a specific complaint, the manner in which, the offence has been committed.

C. ) which aimed to challenge various proceedings initiated under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (D. V. Act). The court discussed the nature of proceedings under the D. V. Act, clarifying that these proceedings are civil in nature but are dealt with under the framework of the Cr. P. C. The court recognized the complexities surrounding legal remedies when it comes to domestic violence cases, particularly the conflicting views among different High Courts regarding the jurisdiction of Family Courts versus Magistrates. The court emphasized that a petition challenging a proceeding under Section 12 of the D. V. Act is not maintainable under Section 482 Cr. P. C. and that while the jurisdiction of the Magistrate is civil, the mechanism for enforcement follows criminal procedural guidelines. The judges reaffirmed the need for proper jurisdictional understanding and the importance of statutory rights of appeal in the context of domestic violence cases.

Sandeep S/O. Shivappa Kakhandaki vs The State Of Karnataka on 21 February, 2025. The petitioners, who have been charge-sheeted for offences punishable under Sections 498A, 323, 504, and 506 read with Section 34 of the IPC, and Section 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, are before this Court seeking relief.

A perusal of the complaint indicates that, except for omnibus and general allegations, there are no specific overt acts attributed to each accused, detailing how and in what manner they subjected the de facto complainant to cruelty.

However, the FIR was registered 4 days later due to fear of defamation. The appellant argued that the delay was fatal to the prosecution case. Nonetheless, the prosecution maintained that the complainant's fear was valid in such cases involving minors. The Court also noted that such delays are not unusual due to societal stigma attached to sexual offences. Ultimately, the Court found that the delay raised doubts about the prosecution’s case and acquitted the appellant, citing lack of strong evidence and suggesting that he was falsely implicated due to a familial dispute.

[case 612]
Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. As the court reviews the bail plea submitted by Satyaprakash, significant emphasis is placed on previous judgments and legal standards surrounding sexual offenses, particularly against minors. The defense challenges the lack of direct evidence, citing delays in the FIR and arguing for the applicant's presumption of innocence. However, the respondent argues that the absence of physical evidence does not diminish the severity of the allegations and cites precedent cases that position the victim's testimony at the forefront of the judicial process. Central to the court's decision-making process is the principle that while the accused is presumed innocent, the nature of the accusations under the POCSO Act necessitates a thorough examination of the circumstances. Particularly, the emphasis is on judicial responsibility to afford protection to minors and the fundamental impacts of sexual crimes on their well-being. Overall, the nature of the offense, the victim's rights, and the broader implications for social justice interlink throughout the proceedings.

[case 613]
Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. The court's ruling reflects broader implications for cases involving allegations of sexual violence against minors under the POCSO Act. The applicant, Satyaprakash, has been implicated in serious offenses involving a minor and is seeking bail while contesting claims made against him. The proceedings highlighted the necessity for the judicial system to address the complexities resulting from delayed FIRs, evolving victim statements and medical examinations that may not provide the expected clarity. The emphasis on the minor’s well-being underscores the importance of decisions that do not compromise victims’ safety or inhibit legal recourses for redress. Furthermore, the role of public sentiment and societal attitudes towards sexual offenses is significant; any ruling must be approached with caution to protect future victims while balancing the rights of the accused. Ultimately, the court's decision to grant bail illustrates a judicial commitment to fair process but acknowledges the persistent risk and potential for harm that the legal context brings.

This case involves the Karnataka High Court ruling on a criminal petition regarding accusations under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. The petitioners include Mallesh, Mahadevamma, Rajesha, Mahadevashetty, and Rathnamma, all accused of facilitating a child marriage involving an underage girl. The marriage allegedly took place while the victim was still a minor, leading to legal actions against the petitioners. The petition seeks to quash the proceedings on the ground that the victim has now attained majority and has voluntarily chosen to live with her husband. The court examines whether the petitioners' request to quash the proceedings can be justified by their claim of a personal settlement and the changed circumstances of the victim. The court refers to a Supreme Court precedent allowing the quashing of cases in certain private nature offenses, even if they are non-compoundable, if they have been settled amicably by the parties involved. Ultimately, the High Court ruled to quash the ongoing proceedings against the petitioners, citing the evolution of circumstances that merited such a decision.

[case 621]
This petition has been filed to call for the records pertaining to the proceedings in Crime No. 17 of 2022 on the file of the respondent police and quash the same. The learned government advocate states that the case is still under investigation and that he opposed allowing this petition. On perusal of the FIR, it reveals that the respondent police had registered a case in Crime No. 17 of 2022 against this petitioner/A2 and another person who is the defacto complainant's husband for the offences under Section 9(1), 9(m), 9(n), 10 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Under Section 506(i) of IPC. The defacto complainant who is the mother of the victim girl has stated that her daughter who is aged about 15 years, was sexually abused by her father-in-law and by her husband and that they both threatened the victim girl not to disclose to any one. This Court finds that the FIR discloses prima facie commission of cognizable offence and as such, this Court cannot interfere with the investigation. Therefore, I find no merits and investigation in this case is to be conducted to find out the truth.

Deepak (A) Deepak Kumar vs The State Of Tamil Nadu on 7 June, 2022. .. Crl. O. P. No. 10435 of 2022. .. The case of the prosecution is that the defacto complainant who is aged about 17 years fell in love with the accused and had sexual intercourse which resulted in registration of FIR. .. . The defacto complainant is about to complete the age of 18 in another six months when the alleged offence reported. She submitted that she is no longer interested in prosecuting the accused, since she voluntarily fell in love with the boy/accused. Though said consent of the minor is not permissible under law, the very object of the POCSO Act is to prevent the sexual offence on the minor children. .. . The provisions of the POCSO Act, as it stands today, will surely make the acts of the boy an offence due to its stringent nature. An adolescent boy caught in a situation like this will surely have no defense if the criminal case is taken to its logical end. .. . Therefore, quashing of the proceedings will not affect the society, in fact it will pave the way for both the victim as well as the accused for their future.

In the Supreme Court of India, the case of Ms. Eera Through Dr. Manjula Krippendorf vs State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) addresses significant legal concerns regarding the interpretation of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). The central issue includes whether the definition of 'child' can encompass not only biological age but also mental age. Here, the appellant, Ms. Eera, is biologically 38 years old but is mentally disabled, with a mental age of approximately 6 to 8 years due to cerebral palsy. The law emphasizes protecting the child's dignity and ensuring judicial proceedings are conducted in a child-friendly atmosphere. The High Court had previously instructed necessary steps to ensure the trial was suitable for a child with such needs. The interpretation of 'child' as defined under Section 2(d) of the POCSO Act is key, where it is stated that 'child' means any person below the age of 18 years. This case deliberates the necessity of staying true to legislative intent while also ensuring the effectiveness of the legal protections intended for children.

They express that any charges against them should not hold without proper legal basis and the court proceedings should respect the legal frameworks that govern such complaints, particularly emphasizing the POCSO Act for child protection and actions mandated to be taken by school authorities in safeguarding children under their care.

Mahalakshmi vs The District Collector on 19 January, 2021. W. P. (MD)NO. 659 OF 2021. This Court ordered notice to the respondents. Dr. R. Rajalakshmi, Assistant Surgeon, after examining the minor girl, opined that her gestational age is about 10-11 weeks and that continuing the pregnancy may endanger her physical and mental health.

The passage discusses the relevant legal provisions surrounding the termination of pregnancy for minors and the involvement of medical authorities.

Juvenile -X vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 24 March, 2023. The Present Criminal Revision has been preferred by the revisionist through his mother under Section 102 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 against the judgment by the Special Judge (POCSO Act), which rejected the bail application of the revisionist under Section 12 of "JJ Act, 2015. " The Juvenile Justice Board had previously declared the revisionist as juvenile. It was submitted that the revisionist was falsely implicated and that there were several contradictions in statements provided by involved parties. The finding recorded by the court was deemed cursory, evaluating factors not based on sufficient evidence. The gravity of the offence was argued to not be a sufficient reason to deny bail. After careful consideration of the submissions from both sides, the Court found that there was no reasonable ground to believe that release would lead to the juvenile associating with known criminals, thus allowing the revision and granting bail with specific conditions for monitoring and welfare.

[case 646]
The case of X vs State of U. P. involved significant discussions regarding the rights of juveniles within the judicial system. The court highlighted how the juvenile justice system is designed to ensure the protection and rehabilitation of minors rather than punishment. The arguments presented indicated that the juvenile, who was just over 14 years old during the incident, had been held in custody following grave charges against him. The court considered whether the legal foundations used by the Juvenile Justice Board and the Appellate Court were adequate, particularly focusing on the procedural requirements pertaining to denying bail. Various sections of the JJ Act were cited which imply that a juvenile’s liberty ought to be prioritized unless certain reasonable grounds indicate otherwise. Additionally, the court emphasized the importance of a social investigation report in evaluating a juvenile's home environment and potential risks associated with their release into society. This highlighted the state’s responsibility to ensure juvenile offenders are treated fairly and justly.

X vs State Of Nct Of Delhi (Acting Through Its. .. on 20 October, 2022. Owing to various emotional, social, and cultural factors, CSA survivors may not be able to express their feelings and experiences. The main rationale for this is that children are traumatized and are unsure of the proper words to express their encounter. CSA has long-lasting negative effects on mental health. It becomes imperative that the survivor of the crime is not overlooked and rehabilitation for the sufferings of the survivor is not overlooked. The Justice Verma committee in its report stated: "No woman in India must feel a sense of shame or stigma in the event of sexual assault. She is entitled to the redressal of that injury and that offence and she is therefore statutorily and constitutionally capable of access to the rule of law. " The prevention of sexual violence is of fundamental importance to survivors’ sense of justice. It entails the transformation of society into one that understands and recognizes the harms of sexual violence and that actively makes efforts to reduce its prevalence.

Satyaprakash vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 28 February, 2025. The prosecution alleges that the applicant enticed away a minor girl under the POCSO Act, leading to serious charges against him. The lack of medical evidence mentioned in the court's reasoning stems from discussions about the victim's medical examination being conducted a few days after the alleged incident, which raises questions regarding the timing and nature of evidence collection. The court expresses concern about the implications of granting bail based on the principle of 'presumption of innocence', yet must balance that against the grave implications of allegations involving minors. Furthermore, legal precedent indicates that the courts must handle such cases with diligence, focusing not only on the rights of the accused but also on the protection of the victim’s rights. Ultimately, the court decides to grant bail, subject to specific conditions to ensure the integrity of the trial process and uphold the legal standards required when dealing with sensitive cases involving minors.

[case 677]
The court's decision involved an analysis of witness testimonies, particularly the prosecutrix's contradictory statements regarding her age, her consent, and her circumstances while staying with the appellant. The examination of legal frameworks, particularly the POCSO Act and relevant court precedents, guided the assessment of whether the prosecutrix was truly a minor at the time of the incident. The court highlighted that in cases involving minors, the prosecution bears the burden of thoroughly establishing this status to uphold any charges of sexual offenses. The prosecutrix's sustenance of a clearly expressed desire to protect the appellant from legal consequences alongside her lack of consistent assertions against him weakened the position of the prosecution. As such, emphasizing the weight given to the testimonies and the need for a strong evidentiary basis to uphold sexual offense charges against the appellant underlines the complexities of cases involving perceived victimhood versus actual consent.

Xxx vs State Of Kerala on 15 January, 2021 The grievance of the petitioners centres around the investigation that is being carried out by the 5th respondent. The petitioners state that the 5th respondent demanded that vehicles should be arranged to go to Thirunelveli and arrest the 6th respondent. As requested, vehicles were arranged by the petitioners and the 6th respondent was arrested and she was brought to Munnar police station. However, her arrest was not recorded and she was left scotfree. It is further stated that the 5th respondent in her official uniform started frequenting the residential home of the petitioners to their chagrin. The 5th respondent also used to go to the school of the 1st petitioner purportedly to record his statement. This created a loss of embarrassment and psychological pressure on the minor boy. Fresh statements were recorded and the petitioners were forced to dilute the allegations. Fed up with the harassment meted out by the 5th respondent, the petitioners had to leave Munnar and started residing at Chengannur.

The Karnataka High Court in the case of Mr. Vivek George Jacob vs State of Karnataka on March 27, 2024, dealt with a writ petition filed by the petitioners to quash an FIR that had been registered against them for various offenses, including dowry harassment. The allegations stemmed from a complaint by Mrs. Elizabeth George, the wife of the first petitioner, claiming continuous mental and financial abuse by her husband and in-laws. She reported that her husband had demanded dowry prior to their marriage and continuously harassed her for money after that, even taking control of her finances. The court reviewed the specific acts detailed in the complaint, noting that the petitioners had admitted to receiving a substantial amount of money and purchasing property jointly owned with the respondent. While the court found insufficient grounds against the parents-in-law (Accused Nos. 2 and 3) for trespassing and harassment, it upheld the proceedings against the husband, citing the clear evidence of abusive behavior as presented by the respondent.

The petitioner comes before this Court questioning the proceedings in Special C. C. No. 1283 of 2024 pending before the Fast Track Special Court-I in Bengaluru. The case stems from a complaint that claims the petitioner, a prominent political figure, is accused of sexually assaulting a minor. The petitioner argues that the allegations are baseless and stem from revenge for political reasons. However, the prosecution has presented recordings and witnesses backing up the complaint, prompting the Court to take cognizance based on available evidence. The law mandates the necessity of a sufficient basis for proceedings as reflected in various Supreme Court judgments regarding the issuance of summons. The Court emphasizes that a magistrate must record reasons for the order of cognizance and process issuance, and failing to do so could render the order void. Thus, while discussing the implications of the proceedings against the petitioner, it is established that judicial scrutiny is necessary, especially given the serious nature of the allegations.

[case 698]
The legal framework under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 emphasizes the necessity of safeguarding juvenile offenders from negative influences and allows for their rehabilitation rather than punitive action. The passage specifies that a juvenile arrested or detained should be released on bail unless there are reasonable grounds that their release would expose them to risk. To evaluate bail pleas for juveniles, courts must analyze the nature of the offense, the minor’s role, their family background, and their associations. This holistic approach is vital as highlighted in recent judgments where the courts emphasized that juvenile cases ought to be handled with care, focusing on rehabilitation. Moreover, the passage touches on a significant ruling by the Supreme Court which underlines the necessity to uphold the rights of juveniles against wrongful detention. This judgment serves as a crucial reference point for juvenile cases, highly advocating for their rights and appropriate treatment in legal contexts.

In the case of State Of Karnataka vs Sri Brahmadeva, the Karnataka High Court reviewed a criminal appeal where the accused was acquitted of charges related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The victim, a minor girl, reported prolonged sexual abuse by her teacher, which was not promptly reported to the authorities, thus raising issues concerning the responsibilities of custodians and the legal framework around the timely reporting of such incidents. The trial court raised concerns about the credibility of the victim's testimony due to the absence of corroborative evidence and the contradictory statements from other witnesses who had firsthand knowledge of the incidents. The prosecution's failure to provide satisfactory explanations for the delay in reporting the abuse further compounded the case leading to the acquittal decision. The appeal was dismissed as the appellate court found the trial court's conclusion was well-supported by the principles of law applicable to sexual offenses against children.

The Present Criminal Revision has been preferred by the revisionist under Section 102 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 to challenge the rejection of his bail application by the Juvenile Justice Board and the appellate court. The revisionist, aged about 17 years at the time of the incident, contends he has been falsely implicated, citing no substantial evidence against him, and requests his release under the JJ Act. The order rejecting his bail refers to his potential association with criminals and lack of control over him by his natural guardian. The court notes that the refusal to bail must have substantial grounds, highlighting the importance of the Social Information Report and the mandatory provisions of the JJ Act. Ultimately, the court reverses the earlier judgments, allowing for the revisionist's bail with specific conditions to ensure he avoids known criminals and focuses on his education and constructive activities.

In the case Pramod Ganpatrao Joshi vs The State Of Maharashtra, the accused was charged with offences punishable under Section 354(A)1 of IPC and under Sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.

State Represented By vs Kathir on 10 October, 2022. The judgment was concerning the acquittal of Kathir under the POCSO Act where the prosecution argued that the evidence provided was sufficient to convict him for the aggravated penetrative sexual assault of a child. The Special Judge found the evidence of the victim and her parents inconsistent and not trustworthy, leading to the acquittal.

After reevaluating the evidence presented, the appellate court found that the trial court had erred in acquitting the respondent, leading to a reversal of the acquittal and a conviction under Section 6 of the POCSO Act, thereby imposing a sentence of ten years imprisonment.

High Court Of Karnataka vs The State Of Karnataka on 13 August, 2021.

In the case of Yunusbhai Usmanbhai Shaikh vs State Of Gujarat on 23 September 2015, the facts outlined that the applicant, Yunusbhai, was accused of kidnapping a minor named Namira, which was litigious and contentious due to the nature of personal law applied to the parties involved. It was stated that Namira, aged 16 years and 4 months at the time of the alleged offense, was said to have left her parental home of her own free will and subsequently married Yunus. The respondent argued the marriage violates the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, which emphasizes the illegality of child marriages, defining a child as a female under 18 years and a male under 21 years. The applicant's defense included points on personal law that purportedly allowed the marriage without parental consent at such a young age, leading to questions about the protection rights of minors under the coercive voices of societal norms against the statutory laws designed to safeguard children from early and forced unions.

Jai Prakash Narain vs State Of Karnataka on 15 September, 2018. This petition is filed under section 482 of Cr. P. C. seeking to quash the FIR registered against the petitioners in Crime No. 350/2014 by the Halasur Gate Police, Bengaluru, for the offences punishable under section 354(A) of Indian Penal Code and section 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. The allegations made against the petitioners in the above complaint are utterly absurd, incredible and inherently improbable. The minor daughter has reiterated these allegations during her examination by the police under section 161 Cr. P. C. and also before the learned Magistrate while giving her statement under section 164 Cr. P. C. The report submitted by the Mediator clearly indicates that an attempt has been made by the second respondent to foist false criminal charges against the petitioners. The continuance of the proceedings against the petitioners based on the allegations has been found to be dubious and suspicious.

The Karnataka High Court case involving Joseph Kevin Selvadoray addresses serious allegations under the POCSO Act. Joseph, who is contesting charges of sexual abuse against his daughter, has a complex marital dispute with Shabana B. S. , the child’s mother. The case stems from a complaint made by Shabana after their daughter learned about inappropriate touching in school. Court rulings have been made regarding visitation rights and interim custody, which have been points of contention between the parties. Joseph claims the allegations are false and aimed at manipulating custody decisions, and has sought anticipatory bail due to fear of arrest. The court emphasized the need to scrutinize such allegations carefully, especially when they arise in the context of custody battles, to avoid using children as tools in parental disputes. The court ultimately ruled in favor of Joseph, granting him bail with conditions to cooperate with the investigation, appearing in court, and not tampering with witnesses.

Sonali Gupta vs Amit Gupta @ Sachin & Ors. on 25 February, 2025. Delhi High Court. Author: Jasmeet Singh. Petitioner Sonali Gupta alleged physical and mental abuse by her husband and in-laws. A Domestic Violence complaint was filed, but the court declined to summon her in-laws. The appellant argued that all involved should be called based on her claims. The judges referenced previous legal definitions regarding 'domestic relationships' within the Domestic Violence Act, affirming that not all must share a household simultaneously to be summoned in cases of alleged abuse. They emphasized the need for applicable judicial scrutiny of vague allegations and the definition of domestic violence. Recognizing that lack of specific proof of abuse could weaken an applicant's case, the judges upheld the lower court's decision that did not compel the summoning of all alleged abusers. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed, allowing for a chance for the appellant to provide adequate proof of her claims.

In the context of the passage, the provisions outlined in the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 significantly prioritize the welfare of juveniles involved in criminal proceedings. The highlighted case of Satyam Yadav reveals that the juvenile justice framework ensures that minors are separated from adult offenders and given a chance for a more supportive environment tailored to their rehabilitation. The legal parameters suggest that juvenile offenders should be placed in observation homes rather than prisons and that any bail consideration must take into account their mental, physical, and emotional states. Hence, the focus is on creating a framework that fosters better outcomes for young individuals rather than limiting their opportunities through traditional punitive measures. Moreover, judicial oversight is crucial in ensuring that all decisions align with the child's best interests as indicated through case law emphasizing humane treatment and attention.

[case 752]
The appellant faced multiple charges, framed under Sections 363 and 366 of IPC, as well as charges under the POCSO Act. During the trial, the prosecution provided various testimonies and documents intended to substantiate the victim status of the prosecutrix and her age—which was argued to be crucial in applying the POCSO Act to the case. The court's examination of evidence, including school records, affidavits from the prosecutrix's father, and testimonies from witnesses aimed at establishing whether the prosecutrix was indeed a minor led to a significant realization. The inconsistencies in testimonies regarding the age of the prosecutrix and the nature of her relationship with the appellant raised doubts sufficient to benefit the accused. The failure of the prosecution to establish clear, reliable evidence regarding the age of the prosecutrix thus led to the ultimate acquittal of the appellant under the stringent provisions of the POCSO Act.

Sri Javed Shafiq Rao vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2025
This case highlights critical aspects of liability in child protection law, particularly in environments where children are present, such as residential complexes. The petitioner faced allegations for the electrocution of a minor due to stated negligence in ensuring safety protocols were followed while the swimming pool area was under his previous management. However, with evidence showing that control had been handed over prior to the incident, the court looked into the feasibility of holding any party liable under IPC sections addressing culpable homicide. The discussions revolved around accountability, especially in contexts where numerous parties could potentially be implicated. The court ultimately acknowledged the chain of command and control, resulting in a quashing of the FIR against the petitioner, deeming there was insufficient basis to hold him liable given the legal transfers of responsibility.

Sri Javed Shafiq Rao vs State Of Karnataka on 10 February, 2025
The case explores the implications of responsibility in negligence claims regarding child safety in residential complexes. In this instance, the petitioner, as Vice President of a property management firm, contested allegations implying negligence led to a child’s electrocution in a swimming pool area. The complaints center on the failure to maintain safety standards and the ensuing tragic death. However, as the management firm had already handed over the facility to a governing homeowners association, arguments were presented that liability for safety and operational control lay with that entity. Thus, the Court assessed the evidence and emphasized that if the petitioner had indeed divested control, imposing liability on him could result in an abuse of legal process. The conclusion emphasized the importance of establishing the chain of responsibility in child safety incidents in residential settings.

[case 805]
In the case of State vs. Hitesh, the court examined the prosecution's claims regarding a 17-year-old girl who alleged she was involved in a sexual relationship with the accused. The prosecution failed to establish the victim's age beyond reasonable doubt, which is crucial under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The trial court acquitted the accused, noting that the victim had consented to the relationship. The High Court of Delhi upheld this decision, emphasizing that without conclusive evidence regarding the victim's age, the case could not support a conviction under the POCSO Act. The prosecution did not sufficiently substantiate the victim's age based on school records and other forms of identification, ultimately leading to the dismissal of the appeal by the state, stating the victim, despite being close to the age of majority, had consented to the relationship and hence, the case lacked the grounds to proceed.

[case 806]
In the case of Dinesh @ Dineshkumar vs State, reported on 8 March 2024, a key issue revolves around the actions of the accused who allegedly had physical relations with a minor girl. The girl, P. W-1, left her home on 26 June 2014 with the accused and was later found under circumstances that led to criminal charges being brought under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The prosecution provided evidence claiming that the girl was taken from her lawful guardians and subjected to sexual assault. The court had to consider various factors including the age of consent, the nature of their relationship, and the factual circumstances surrounding her departure from home, which ultimately led to a conviction for the accused. However, upon review, the appellate court found that the original trial might have erred in interpreting the evidence, especially regarding the voluntary aspect of the girl's departure and her subsequent actions.

The bail application under Section 12 of ‘JJ Act, 2015’ has been rejected by the Juvenile Justice Board and appellate court on several grounds, including the belief that the revisionist may associate with known criminals.

The Juvenile Justice Act provides specific guidelines to ensure the protection of juveniles, and the circumstances under which a juvenile may be denied bail are clearly defined. The case highlights the balance between the gravity of the offense and the rights of juveniles under the law.

The well-known principle of 'Presumption of Innocence Unless Proven Guilty' gives rise to bail as a rule and imprisonment as an exception.

In the case of Irfan Mehmud Pathan vs The Sr. Police Inspector on 17 October 2018, the Bombay High Court reviewed two criminal appeals related to the rejection of bail applications under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, concerning serious accusations against the appellants for a crime that involved the abuse of two minor children from a Scheduled Caste. The court heard the arguments from both sides, including the seriousness of the offenses, the evidence presented, and the implications of the actions taken by the appellants. The High Court ultimately deemed that the risk of tampering with evidence warranted the dismissal of the appeals and directed that the trial should proceed expeditiously. The decision highlights the need for sensitivity towards the legal protections afforded to vulnerable populations under child protection laws and the obligations of the court to uphold these laws vigorously.

The applicants denied the accusations, claiming they have been falsely implicated. The court also noted that the two victims included a minor aged 15 years, leading to the application of the POCSO Act. The court ultimately denied the anticipatory bail, citing the seriousness of the charges and the potential for tampering with evidence.

[case 816]
The petitioner has been arrayed as the sole accused in Crime No. 879/2019 of Alappuzha South Police Station, which has been registered for offences punishable under Secs. 7 & 8 of the POCSO Act, 2012. The gist of the prosecution case is that, on 6. 6. 2019 at about 12. 30 pm the petitioner accused aged 29 years with the intention to sexually abuse the minor girl child aged 11 years, had caught hold of her hand at the playground of St. Anthony's L. P. School, Alappuzha, and when the girl's brother and others had intervened, he fled away and hid himself in a bathroom. Later he was arrested on 6. 6. 2019 and has been under judicial custody since then. Counsel for the petitioner would point out that the abovesaid allegations have been falsely foisted on him, and that taking into consideration the nature of the allegations in this crime, his continued detention is no longer necessary as he has already suffered detention for the last more than 40 days.

He allegedly repeated the act on 07. 09. 2019. I find that a coordinate Bench of this Court had occasion to consider the application seeking bail filed by the petitioner and after a detailed analysis of the facts and circumstances had denied bail by order dated 5. 5. 2020. The materials available portray that the act allegedly committed by the petitioner reek of extreme depravity.

[case 818]
In the case of X vs State (NCT of Delhi) & Anr. , the petitioner seeks to set aside an order granting bail to the respondent No. 2, who has been accused of raping a woman suffering from bipolar disorder. The prosecutrix, represented by her father, had initially shown mental vulnerabilities that were manipulated by the accused. The argument is based on a failure of the court to recognize the effect of her mental state on her ability to consent, alongside the serious nature of the crimes committed. The court evaluates various factors in determining the bail conditions and eventually the application for bail was cancelled due to the gravity of the charges and the apparent manipulation of the prosecutrix's condition by the accused. The learned Additional Sessions Judge noted contradictions and failures in the statements given during the bail hearing, ultimately leading to the decision that bail was improperly granted and should be rescinded.

[case 819]

A s per prosecution story, the applicant had manipulated the prosecutrix and on false promise of marriage had called her to his house. The prosecutrix after coming back home had narrated the whole incident to her parents and FIR was lodged. The learned counsel for the applicant submits that the applicant is innocent. Per contra, learned Panel Lawyer opposes the bail application and submits that the applicant’s innocence is disputed or questioned in light of the serious nature of the charges brought against him.

[case 820]
In a notable case on 7th May 2018, the court reviewed the facts surrounding State vs. Pankaj Kumar Jha regarding the sexual assault of a prosecutrix who is related to the accused by marriage. The prosecutrix contended that her brother-in-law, over a span of several years, blackmailed her and coerced her into sexual relations through threats, including exposure of intimate photographs. The prosecution argued that the accused's consistent threats influenced the prosecutrix's compliance, thus undermining her consent. The court examined the circumstances under which the prosecutrix's consent was allegedly obtained and the implications of coercion and fear in legal determinations regarding consent. Ultimately, the evidence painted a grim picture of the abuse the prosecutrix endured, leading to her eventual disclosure of the crime to her family and law enforcement, culminating in the filing of multiple legal complaints against the accused.

[case 821]
This petition for release on bail under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr. P. C), in case arising out of first information report (FIR) no. 224/2016, involving offences punishable under Sections 354A/365/367/376/377/342/506 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC) and Section 4 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) of police station Nabi Karim, has brought to light a very disturbing background. The petitioner, accused in two session cases involving sexual offences against a child, has faced serious allegations supported by the prosecutrix’s testimony. The case has raised concerns over the safety of the prosecutrix as intimidation attempts reportedly follow her testimony in court. These procedural elements provoke inquiry into what legal protections and actions are available to ensure the prosecutrix's safety and the integrity of the judicial process.

Shadaan Ansari vs State Of U. P. & 2 Others on 14 January, 2020. This revision has been filed for quashing of the order dated 21. 09. 2019 passed by Additional Sessions Judge/Special Judge (POCSO Act), Faizabad in Special Session Trial No. 78 of 2018, arising out of F. I. R. No. 76 of 2018, under Sections 376, 506, 377 I. P. C. and Section 3/4 POCSO Act. The revisionist was not in a position to engage a lawyer, resulting in Amicus Curiae being assigned at the state’s expense. However, the Amicus Curiae did not effectively cross-examine the prosecution witnesses. The petitioner's argument cites the violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India regarding the right to fair trial due to inadequate legal aid. The High Court concluded that the legal aid provided was not effective as it failed to ensure a fair trial, leading to the quashing of the previous order and allowing the revisionist the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.

C and the proviso is very clear that if the trial Court, at the conclusion of the trial, is satisfied, that the compensation awarded under Section 357 of Cr. P. C is not adequate for such rehabilitation, or where the cases end in acquittal or discharge and the victim has to be rehabilitated, it may make recommendation for compensation. In Crl. R. P. No. 810/2022, the learned counsel brought to notice of this Court paragraph 49 of the order of the Trial Court wherein the Trial Court has made an observation that with regard to awarding compensation is concerned, though the prosecution has failed to bring home the guilt of the accused by producing consisting and corroborative evidence, but as per the medical evidence, it appears that she was sexually assaulted and she has suffered mental agony.

This Criminal Original Petition has been filed to quash the proceedings in Spl. S. C. No. 193 of 2023 on the file of the learned Special Court for the Exclusive Trial of POCSO Act Cases, Dindigul. The case has been registered for offences under Sections 366 of IPC and Sections 366(A), 363 of IPC and Sections 9, 5(l), 5(j)(ii) and 6 of POCSO Act. It is settled law that the High Court has inherent power under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to quash the criminal proceedings even for the offences which are not compoundable under Section 320 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, where the parties have settled their dispute between themselves. However, while quashing the criminal proceedings, based on the settlement arrived at between the parties, the High Court should act with caution and the power should be exercised sparingly only in order to secure the ends of justice and also to prevent abuse of process of any Court.

[case 838]
The case State Of Karnataka vs Sri Brahmadeva presented in the Karnataka High Court involved serious allegations under the POCSO Act against a Physical Training Teacher accused of sexual abuse of a minor girl. The decision of acquittal has raised questions about the evidentiary standards in sexual abuse cases. The trial court highlighted a significant delay in reporting the incident which, combined with hostile witness testimonies, contributed to the defendant's acquittal. The case illustrates the legal principle that the prosecution bears the burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, particularly in cases of alleged child abuse where consistency and corroborative evidence are crucial. It also sparks a dialogue on the importance of supportive legal frameworks that can protect the rights of the child and ensure that allegations of this nature are not only taken seriously but investigated thoroughly and expediently.

[case 839]
In a significant ruling, a political figure is accused of committing acts against a minor, with allegations forming the basis for multiple charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and the Indian Penal Code. The petitioner challenges the legitimacy of the complaint arguing that it is either politically motivated or frivolous. However, the prosecution has a responsibility to substantiate its claims, supported by audio recordings that corroborate the claims made by the complainant. The magistrate's role necessitates a thorough review of evidence to determine whether sufficient grounds exist to proceed with the charges. The importance of this examination is underscored by the legal principles set out in prior judgments that necessitate a careful application of judicial scrutiny at every stage of the process, highlighting the protective layer the law seeks to afford the vulnerable individuals involved.

[case 840]
The passage discusses provisions concerning the Pre­conception and Pre­natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, highlighting the issues faced by medical practitioners due to the strict punitive measures defined within. The Association argues that Section 23(2) allows the indefinite suspension of a medical practitioner's registration based solely on allegations raised during preliminary investigations, a practice perceived as violating Article 21, thus denying the presumption of innocence until proven guilty—a principle enshrined in the Constitution. This situation has led to the assertion that clerical errors should not trigger such severe legal consequences which prevent physicians from practicing and providing essential health care, especially to women who may need their services. Legal avenues for challenging these suspensions are also noted, alongside the constant need for safeguarding the rights of the medical practitioners.

[case 841]
In the case of Sayyed Usman S/O Sayyedmohiddin vs The State Of Karnataka on 15 January, 2025, the Karnataka High Court addressed serious allegations against the petitioners related to child marriage offenses. Registered by the Betageri Police, the FIR stemmed from a complaint by the President of the Child Welfare Committee, emphasizing the illegal marriage of a minor boy conducted by the petitioners, who held significant roles in their community. The court meticulously reviewed the implications of Sections 10 and 11 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act to assess their necessary elements, finding a lack of evidence that the petitioners were directly responsible for solemnizing the minor's marriage. Thus, proceedings against them were quashed, illustrating a critical interpretation of legal defenses available when individuals are accused of participating in child marriages without sufficient proof of their involvement.

[case 842]
The petitioner, who is the mother of a minor child, challenges the order of the Family Court, Thrissur in Execution Application No. 130 of 2020. The Family Court directed the decree holder-father to have custody of the child. The petitioner impugns the order on the ground that the father has perpetrated a sexual offence on the minor child. The Family Court examined and interacted with the child who described the incidents of abuse. The judge concluded that the allegations were false based on an investigation report. The Family Courts need to evaluate allegations of abuse cautiously, ensuring that merely registering a complaint does not automatically grant custody rights in favor of the other parent. This case illustrates the complexities involved in custody disputes, especially when allegations of abuse arise and highlights the necessity for proper judicial scrutiny to protect the rights and welfare of the child involved.

[case 846]
Within the high court's jurisdiction, considerations for the ruling against Raj Kishore entailed a multifactorial analysis of age determination, prosecutrix statements, and the evidentiary standards necessary for a conviction under the POCSO Act. The prosecution's reliance on school admission forms as proof of the prosecutrix's age failed to suffice in the court's assessment, given the observed discrepancies developed during testimony evaluations. Furthermore, the prosecutrix's retraction of her initial statements regarding the nature of her relationship with the appellant caused substantial doubts concerning the validity of claims made against him. The imperative for concrete evidence surrounding age thresholds illustrated the necessity for precision in legal proceedings involving minors, thereby heightening the repercussions for erroneous assumptions in such sensitive cases.

[case 847]

Now, the petitioner seeks to appeal the conviction and have her sentence suspended pending the outcome. The court emphasizes the need for accountability for the convicted regarding abuses and cruelties inflicted upon the minor victims.

Juvenile -X vs State Of U. P. And Another on 2 March, 2023. The judgment elaborates on the legal framework surrounding juvenile bail under the Juvenile Justice Act, specifically Section 12, which traditionally presumes bail should be granted unless there are strong reasons against it. The court emphasized that if a juvenile is to be denied bail, it must be based on the risk assessment regarding potential harm or criminal association if released. The judgment underlines the importance of the social investigation report prepared by the Probation Officer to inform the court decisions about the bail conditions. In this case, the juvenile was initially denied bail due to concerns about his potential exposure to criminal influences, despite a lack of prior criminal history or substantiated adverse findings against him. Ultimately, the court allowed for bail under specific conditions aimed at the juvenile’s rehabilitation.

In the case of Prakash @ Parashivamurthy vs The State Of Karnataka, the accused, Prakash, is charged under multiple sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The case involves a 16-year-old girl (CW2), who was allegedly subjected to sexual abuse and kidnapping by Prakash.

This case raises significant issues regarding the interpretation of consent in relation to minors and the importance of safeguarding children under the law. The petition for bail has been denied based on the likelihood of tampering with the victim and the gravity of the offenses.

The ruling emphasized the legal necessity of determining the prosecutrix’s exact age as a fundamental aspect of ascertaining whether the provisions of the POCSO Act could be enforced. The court analyzed the methods that should be utilized to accurately establish age when disputes arise, settling on a legal framework that calls for corroboration, documentation, and substantial evidence specifically reflecting the prosecutrix being a minor. The court's dismissal of the appellant's conviction was heavily influenced by the prosecutrix's final statement expressing her reluctance to pursue charges against him, which, along with the ambiguous evidence of her age raised fundamental questions about the integrity of the charges. Thus, this decision signifies how the legal system attempts to balance the protection of minors while recognizing personal agency in relational contexts.

[case 883]
The issue before us is limited but one of considerable public importance – whether sexual intercourse between a man and his wife being a girl between 15 and 18 years of age is rape? Exception 2 to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (the IPC) answers this in the negative, but in our opinion, sexual intercourse with a girl below 18 years of age is rape regardless of whether she is married or not. The exception carved out in the IPC creates an unnecessary and artificial distinction between a married girl child and an unmarried girl child and has no rational nexus with any unclear objective sought to be achieved. The artificial distinction is arbitrary and discriminatory and is definitely not in the best interest of the girl child. The artificial distinction turns a blind eye to trafficking of the girl child and surely each one of us must discourage trafficking which is such a horrible social evil.

C. ) 312/2018, which was dismissed by the Division Bench as meritless vide order dated 26. 03. 2019.

The Karnataka High Court case of Sayyed Usman S/O Sayyedmohiddin vs The State Of Karnataka, decided on January 15, 2025, centers around the legal interpretation of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act principles. The petitioners, accused as members of their local mosque's leadership, were alleged to have played a role in the marriage of a minor. A complaint initiated by the local Child Welfare Committee prompted the legal action. The court actively examined the framework of Sections 10 and 11 regarding engagement in child marriages, ultimately finding that the charges against the petitioners lacked sufficient evidential basis for prosecution due to the absence of specific allegations of their involvement. This led to the dismissal of the case against them and reinforced the need for legal justification in child marriage matters.

Act could be undermined.

[case 1097]
The case of State Of Karnataka vs Sri Brahmadeva emphasizes the need for judicial scrutiny in child sexual abuse cases under the POCSO Act, where the prosecution's inability to establish a strong corroborative foundation led to an acquittal of the alleged perpetrator. The victim's testimony, despite the severity of the allegations, faced challenges due to inconsistencies in witness statements and prolonged delays in reporting to authorities that significantly hindered the prosecution's case. The ruling highlights a vital point: that while children need to be protected legally, their evidence must also be scrutinized judiciously to prevent wrongful accusations or acquittals on the flip side, thus creating a tightrope that legal systems must navigate to balance both protection for children and fairness for the accused.

The assertions highlighted the lack of adequate safety measures, and the petitioner stated that control was relinquished well before the occurrence.

[case 1117]
Juvenile -X vs State Of U. P. And 3 Others on 24 March, 2023. The Juvenile Justice Board ruled on a bail application stating there were grounds to believe the juvenile would be a danger to himself or society if released.

In this context, the submissions from both the prosecution and defense were examined rigorously. The Court concluded the lower courts had not adequately considered all elements, thus allowing the bail.

C. , mentioning that the provisions of this law should be exercised with caution based on the evidence recorded in court.

[case 1130]
In Mahalakshmi vs The District Collector case, the minor J was reported to have been kidnapped and subjected to sexual assault, resulting in pregnancy. The case illustrates the legal framework surrounding the termination of pregnancies for minors as set out in the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, which acknowledges that a minor's pregnancy can only be terminated under certain conditions, including the necessity of obtaining consent from her guardian, which poses particular challenges when the minor does not have a competent guardian available. In this case, the uncle sought the termination of the pregnancy due to health risks highlighted by a medical professional. The Court thus weighed the importance of protecting the minor's health against the legal requirements for terminating a pregnancy.

[case 1131]

[case 1133]

Throughout judicial assessments, the priority remains to ensure that proper procedures are established which respect the dignity and facilitate victim testimonies. These legal determinations amplify the urgency for reformed interpretations that align with the core purpose of the POCSO Act, which is aimed at providing the necessary protections against exploitation and abuse.

[case 1136]
The further argument of the learned Counsel for the appellant/accused, regarding the discrepancy in the manner of registration of the First Information Report is concerned, it can be seen from the evidence of P. W. 1 that she had confronted the mother of the appellant/accused initially and then taken up with the other villagers and finally the complaint was lodged. Considering the nature and background of the parties and the fact that the parents of the victim/child were also not with the child and the child was under the care of his grand-mother, the delay in lodging a complaint is clearly explained and in any event, I am of the view that the same has not caused any prejudice to the appellant/accused especially when he is the sole accused and was a known person and there is no any quarrel over identity.

The ruling in X Juvenile's case demonstrates how the practical application of Section 12 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act brings focus to the rights of minors in the court system. The court noted that not only must the individual circumstances of the juvenile be established, but also reliable assurance that the juvenile would not be endangered if released. The court view was that without concrete evidence indicating that releasing the juvenile would subject him to criminal associations or harm, the intrinsic right of every child to the presumption of innocence and the benefits of rehabilitation must guide the decision to grant bail—or deny it. This reflects an overarching commitment to ensuring justice while nurturing the potential for a troubled youth's return to society.

In the case of S. Amutha vs C. Manivanna Bhupathy dated 2 February, 2007, the Madras High Court addressed critical legal topics related to child testimony in the context of parental divorce. The minor child, Aravind, had been summoned to testify against his mother by his father amidst a custody dispute. The mother’s objection led to the court analyzing whether a child could competently provide evidence. The trial court dismissed her claims, stating that under the law, children could testify as long as they understand the proceedings, a ruling that raises significant questions about child protection and judicial responsibility in family law. This ruling highlights the balance courts must maintain between verifying the competency of minor witnesses and the overarching goal of supporting child well-being.

[case 1143]
In the case of State vs. Hitesh, the court emphasized the legal complexities surrounding cases involving minors, particularly regarding consent. The prosecution's failure to establish the victim's age was critical in this decision, as the law guards minors from exploitation. The High Court of Delhi underscored that while the statutory age of consent is vital, it is equally important to consider the context, maturity, and nature of relationships involving minors. The acquittal hinged on the lack of definitive proof regarding the age of the victim and her own statements about consenting to the relationship, which complicated the application of the POCSO Act. The court insisted upon rigorous standards for evidence, affirming that a minor’s consent cannot be misinterpreted to undermine legal protections.

[case 1144]
A 19-year-old named Rakesh faces charges under Section 376(2)(n) of the IPC, Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, and Section 9 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act.

Despite serious allegations related to child marriage and sexual offences, the court noted that the continuance of trials might lead to injustice, especially for the victim. This scenario raises questions about legal remedies in cases involving minors and the complexities of the law surrounding their protection.

The Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) has highlighted significant issues regarding the legal framework of the Pre­conception and Pre­natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, particularly sections related to punitive measures for clerical errors. The Federation argues that the Act’s current application leads to unreasonable punishments for clerical errors found within medical record-keeping, causing undue harassment and mental distress for medical practitioners even when they are operating without malice or intent to harm. This leads to fears that such regulations could be deemed unconstitutional as they disrupt the balance between enforcing laws against serious offences like female foeticide and punishing individuals for inadvertent errors.

[case 1168]
The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there are absolutely no signs of penetrative sexual assault and at the best, the report only shows that there could have been a sexual assault. We are not in agreement with this submission made by the learned counsel for the appellant. The victim child has described the incident, when she deposed before the Court and she has specifically stated that the appellant had placed his penis over the vagina of the victim child. Section 3 of the POCSO Act explains penetrative sexual assault and Section 3(a) of the POCSO Act makes it clear that there is no requirement that the penis should have completely penetrated the vagina. Hence, sexual assault as described by the victim child clearly satisfies the requirement under Section 3(a) of the POCSO Act.
